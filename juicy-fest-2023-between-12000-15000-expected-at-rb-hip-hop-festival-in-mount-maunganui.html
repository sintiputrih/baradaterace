Tauranga is a stunning place with so much to offer, and as someone who lives and works here, I want to be able to help showcase this city as widely as possible.</p><p>“We hope that by including Tauranga, along with every other centre on our tour, these cities and New Zealand will be exposed to the world and, in turn, boost tourism and our economy.”</p><p>Meikle said the artists had about 90 million followers from around the world between them on their social media channels, “and with that comes influence, which means the potential to showcase our city to the world is definitely there”.</p><p>“Their schedules for the tour are pretty tight, but for most of them this is their first time in Tauranga, and they’re keen to see as much of the city as they can.</p><p>“We have locals with our artists sharing their own knowledge and also recommending spots to visit for each location. If there is time, I’m sure they’ll pop out to experience some of what Tauranga has to offer.”</p><p>The festival was yet to sell out, with limited tickets still available, he said.</p><p>Rain, possibly heavy, with strong north-easterlies easing by the evening was forecast for Friday, according to MetService.</p><p>Meikle said the wind was what to watch out for, but the forecast was “not looking too bad”.</p><p>”We might get some showers, so make sure you bring your wet-weather gear.”</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>As an event promoter, Meikle said he was “gutted” for the organisers of A Summer’s Day.</p><p>”Covid last year was hard enough. You spend the whole year working for this day, and it is gutting, but safety first. They will live to fight another day.”</p><p>Speaking to the <i>Bay of Plenty Times</i> ahead of the festival, American R&B singer-songwriter Mýa said she was excited to be back in New Zealand.</p><p>“It is so welcoming here. It was a beautiful ceremony at the airport,” she said.</p><p>“It is just the best way to start a new year.

Her hits include <i>Lady Marmalade</i>, <i>It’s All About Me</i>, <i>The Best of Me</i>, and <i>Movin’ On</i>.</p><p>Mýa said she was excited to be the only female as part of the Juicy Fest lineup: “It is so cool.”</p><p>It brought back memories from her very first tour in 1998, the Smokin’ Groove Tour, when she performed with various male hip-hop artists including Busta Rhymes, Cypress Hill, and the Black Eyed Peas (minus Fergie).</p><p>Mýa said Juicy Fest would bring the best of live singing, dancing, and hip-hop and R&B.</p><p>“I love variety and energy. I am going to take you down memory lane with some ‘90s jams.

I transform into a different person when I am on stage.”</p><p>During her last trip to New Zealand in 2016 for her Mýa NZ Club Tour, the artist said she did not have much time to explore the country after performing back-to-back shows.</p><p>“I didn’t have much time to hang out. I am hoping for some downtime this time around,” she said.</p><p>The singer-songwriter did, however, get to experience some of New Zealand’s Māori culture and learned how a hangi was cooked.</p><p>“I love learning about the culture everywhere I go.”</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Mýa said she also hoped to find some time to relax on the beach and go skydiving while she was here.</p><p>“I love adventure sports, relaxing, and enjoying a bit of nature.”</p><p>In preparation for the tour, Mýa said she had been working virtually with her Australian dancers, and learning some new choreography.</p><p>“My DJ is from New Zealand.
