I couldn't read any of the [options]; I had no idea what I was ordering,” she confessed.</p><p>She went on to explain, "You just pick a button and you get a coin and then you give it to the person making the soup and you just get whatever you get. And I got this bizarre thing with raw fish on top.”</p><p>Although she says it was “really good,” she “just had no idea what [she] was ordering.” Ironically, the actress says it’s these “kind of exciting adventures where you just end up not knowing what to expect” that she likes!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by alexandra daddario (@alexandradaddario)</a></p></figure><p>Fortunately, Alexandra’s travels don’t always involve her getting lost.</p><p>When things do go as planned, she says “that’s when it’s great.” Plus, she also accrues tons of points when she uses her Hilton Honors American Express Aspire card to fund her trips which is why she decided to collaborate with the two companies.</p><p>“I really think they are amazing companies and I’ve been using their cards for years," Alexandra explained. "I thought this was really an incredible time to do it because they are basically continuing their long-standing relationship — Hilton and American Express, and now you get more points for using their card. You get more for free, and you get more trips, and it makes traveling easier, and traveling is such an important part of my life."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Speaking of travel, Alexandra is excited about ‘The White Lotus’ Season 3.</h2><p>While on the subject of traveling, we only thought it was right to ask Alexandra about the upcoming <a href=#>third season of The White Lotus,</a> which is taking place in Thailand (and let’s be honest, we’re all craving new information about the series).</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Mario Perez/HBO</span></figure><p>While she did bring up <a href=#>Natasha Rothwell</a>’s return for Season 3 (yes, she’ll be back!), Alexandra says she’d be happy to see anyone in the upcoming season.</p><p>“[Mike White] always picks a really cool cast and gives people great opportunities," she said of The White Lotus creator. “So I'm just excited for the people who get to have that experience.” And we are too!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrmmxMCnm6uZXZmupbDAq6CoZaSnrrexy2auoaGkmnqtu9Ouqg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
