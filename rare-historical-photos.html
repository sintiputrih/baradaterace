This is what makes this photo of the atomic cloud rising over Nagasaki on August 9, 1945 so devastating.

This otherwise unremarkable view from the window of a Burgundy, France estate is in fact the oldest surviving, permanent photograph in existence.<p>Taken in 1826 or 1827 by French photography pioneer Joseph Nicéphore Niépce, this image used a unique process known as heliography. First, Niépce set his camera to an eight-hour exposure over a pewter plate coated with asphalt. He then wiped away the areas of the asphalt not hardened by sunlight to reveal a primitive photograph.</p></span><span class=credit>Joseph Nicéphore Niépce/Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Lincoln On The Battlefield</h2><img alt="Lincoln Standing On Battlefield" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/standing-on-battlefield.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Our collective image of Abraham Lincoln likely comes from either painted portraits or a small group of studio shots by photographer Matthew Brady.<p>To see Lincoln out in the real world and towering over his peers is another thing altogether. Pictured: Lincoln stands on the battlefield at Antietam, Maryland with Allan Pinkerton (the famed military intelligence operative who essentially invented the Secret Service, left) and Major General John A.

This photo was taken in 1860, around 15 years before the reformist government abolished this warrior class.</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>The Assassination Of Robert F.

Still, many of these photos provide but a distant survey of the battle scene.<p>This photo (entitled "Into the Jaws of Death"), on the other hand, brings the event to life by offering the perspective of Allied soldiers about to storm the beaches and make history.</p></span><span class=credit>Robert F.

All totaled, Gettysburg was the costliest battle ever fought in the U.S. Partially titled "A harvest of death," this image begins to reveal that cost.</p></span><span class=credit>Timothy H.

While the war generated heated debate at home, this capture marked a decisive moment in the Iraq War and the larger War on Terror.<p>Images of a haggard Hussein post-capture made headlines around the world, but the photos of the actual capture largely didn't. Here, we see just that: Iraqi-native-turned-American-translator known only as Samir holds Hussein to the ground just after U.S. forces discovered him.</p></span><span class=credit>U.S. Army/Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>The Eiffel Tower Under Construction</h2><img alt="Eiffel Tower Under Construction" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/eiffel-tower.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Because the image of the Eiffel Tower is so iconic, there's a jarring visual clang in seeing it unfinished.<p>This July 1888 photo reveals a rare glimpse of the tower under construction, 15 months into the process and still nine months away from completion.</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Unboxing The Statue Of Liberty</h2><img alt="Unboxing The Statue Of Liberty" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/liberty-face.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Much like the Eiffel Tower, it's hard to think of the Statue of Liberty as anything other than a timeless colossus. It was of course a statue built by human hands, and one which France shipped to the States in 214 crates and had an assembly cost of about $10 million (adjusted for inflation).<p>On June 17, 1885, those crates reached the U.S. and the great unboxing began. Pictured: The statue's face not long after removal from its crate.</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Pearl Harbor (Like You've Never Seen It Before)</h2><img alt="Pearl Harbor Explosions" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/pearl-harbor-planes.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Many photos of the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor exist, but none illuminate the moment quite like this one.<p>While other images of exploding ships provide a sense of the chaos, this image, with stunned soldiers in the foreground, brings the true scale and anarchy of that destruction into focus.</p></span><span class=credit>U.S. Navy/National Archives/Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>The San Francisco Earthquake Of 1906</h2><img alt="San Francisco Earthquake" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/earthquake-street.jpg> <span class=caption-body>With at least hundreds more deaths than Pearl Harbor, the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 remains the second deadliest disaster in U.S. history. The quake began on the morning of April 18, and by the time it ended, the quake had leveled about 90 percent of the city, left 225,000 homeless, and at least 3,000 dead.<p>Yet amid that pandemonium, at least one photographer managed to capture a stark, evocative image that reveals the $10 billion destruction.</p></span><span class=credit>Arnold Genthe/Library of Congress</span><h2 class=title>Vincent Van Gogh's Actual Portrait</h2><img alt="Van Gogh Photo Portrait" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/van-gogh.jpeg> <span class=caption-body>By 1873, the camera was an established enough invention that it wasn't unheard of for even a 19-year-old art dealer like Vincent van Gogh to have been photographed.<p>Not only is this just one of two confirmed photographs of the famous painter (and the only one of him post childhood), this photo provides a jarring look at the actual visage of a man we tend only to envision by way of his famous self-portraits.</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Lincoln's Funeral</h2><img alt="Abraham Lincoln's Funeral" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/lincoln-funeral-march.jpg> <span class=caption-body>On April 15, 1865 — just six days after the surrender at Appomattox effectively ended the Civil War — John Wilkes Booth assassinated Abraham Lincoln.<p>Four days later, on April 19, the nation mourned as funeral marchers made their way down Pennsylvania Ave. in Washington, D.C.</p></span><span class=credit>Library of Congress</span><h2 class=title>The Shot That Started World War I</h2><img alt="Gavrilo Princip Being Arrested" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/princip.jpg> <span class=caption-body>The (overly) simple version of the story goes that World War I began when Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914.<p>Here, we can see police arrest the man who "started it all" just after the assassination.

These Confederate sympathizers planned to revive the Confederacy by assassinating Lincoln as well as Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William Seward.<p>Unlike Booth, they failed to follow through. Like Booth, they were eventually captured and killed. On July 7, 1865, four of the plotters — Mary E. Surratt, Lewis T. Powell, David E. Herold, and George A.

While as many as 1.5 million Armenians perished in Turkey (almost as great as the percentage of Jews who would die in Nazi-controlled Europe) between 1915 and 1922, much of the world has forgotten.<p>Of the images that have survived, many portray Armenians being rounded up for execution. Fewer show the brutal reality of those executions.

Because of Edison inventions like the light bulb, the motion picture camera, and the phonograph, people now had entirely new ways to record and communicate the human experience for both ourselves and the generations that followed.<p>In spite of our familiarity with Edison's inventions, it's rare to see the genesis of those inventions themselves.

Accounts vary, but most say a scuffle started after one Lakota refused to give up his rifle. In the end, more than 400 troops killed as many as 300 Lakota men, women, and children, and wounded another 50.

Fought near the Little Bighorn River in southern Montana on June 25 and 26, 1876, this U.S. defeat at the hands of the Lakota and accompanying tribes became famous for Custer's Last Stand, the ill-fated charge of troops led by George Custer, resulting in his death and the death of most of his men.<p>Pictured: Bones at the site of Custer's Last Stand in the aftermath of the battle.</p></span><span class=credit>Stanley J.

Yet of the approximately 300,000 people who flocked to northwestern Canada in search of gold between 1896 and 1899, a few owned and brought cameras.<p>However scarce, these images provide a glimpse into a period when dysentery and malaria were the norm and food was so scarce that salt was worth its weight in gold.
