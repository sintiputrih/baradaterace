Lee Wynne, 23, were taken into custody outside their home in Costa Mesa, “for the shooting death of six-year-old Aiden Leos”, said the California Highway Patrol (CHP).</p><p>Their relationship was not immediately known.</p><p>But, according to KTLA, they are boyfriend and girlfriend and their car was found in another location.</p><p>The Los Angeles Times cited a law enforcement source saying that Eriz is an auto detailer.</p><p>Another law enforcement source told the Times that the suspects were under surveillance before their arrests for <a href=#>Aiden’s fatal shooting</a>.</p><p>Investigators watching the duo followed them from a restaurant before arresting them outside their home on Sunday June 6, said <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CBS Los

under surveillance, and so at some point, we knew they were together in a restaurant today.</p><p>“It was a decision that was made today that that obviously wasn’t a safe place to make the arrest.”</p><p>A $500,000 reward offered for information leading to an arrest had prompted hundreds of tips, according to the CHP.</p><p>The reward money was provided by the boy’s grieving family, businesses and Orange County officials.</p><p>CHP Commissioner Amanda Rey said: “While these arrests will not ease the pain of a mother’s loss, my hope is for the Leos family to have some peace of mind and to rest assured the CHP will work with the Orange County District Attorney to bring justice for Aiden.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

noopener">&nbsp;shot while riding in the back seat of his mother’s car</a>&nbsp;last month after she reportedly angered another driver who cut her off on State Route 55 in the city of Orange.</p><p>The tragic <a href=#>death</a> unfolded on 55 freeway near Chapman at around 8am on May 21, 2021, as Aiden’s mom, Joanna Cloonan, was driving him to kindergarten in her silver Chevrolet Sonic.</p><p>She gave the finger to a driver in her review mirror, but as she switched lanes, a male gunman believed to have been sitting in the passenger’s seat of a car driven by a woman, suddenly fired into her vehicle.</p><p>The single gunshot&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">struck little Aiden in the back</a>.</p><p>His mother pulled over to the side of the road and cradled him in her arms until an off-duty police officer raced over to administer CPR.</p><p>He was taken by ambulance to the Children’s Hospital of Orange County where he was pronounced dead.&nbsp;</p><p>Aiden’s heartbreaking final words were said to be “Mommy, my tummy hurts.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

as a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>2018-2019 white Volkswagen Golf SportsWagen</a>&nbsp;with non-tinted windows and a sunroof.&nbsp;</p><p>Highway patrol officials said the road rage death stemmed from a perceived unsafe lane change.</p><p>The family had pleaded with the suspects to come forward as the young boy’s funeral was held on Saturday, June 5.</p><p>His mom said: “The joy he brought into our lives was insurmountable.</p><p>“My heart melted every time he laughed.”</p><p>“The family and our community deserve closure to this horrific event,” Orange County Supervisor Don Wagner said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
