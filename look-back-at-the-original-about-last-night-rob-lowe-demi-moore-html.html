It did just fine at the box office, earned decent reviews, and then went straight into the Trivia Night folders. So on the occasion of the remake — starring Kevin Hart, Regina Hall, Michael Ealy, and Joy Bryant, out this Friday — here are some things to remember (or learn) about the original <i>About Last Night</i>.<br></span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-794832434fbc59414325e54991ca0a07-3-0-0@published data-word-count=129><span><b>Rob Lowe is not very good at Mamet lines.</b><br><i>About Last Night</i> is based on the 1974 David Mamet play <i>Sexual Perversity in Chicago</i>, which, as you might guess from the title, is about four young people in Chicago who say a lot of crude things about relationships. Mamet didn’t write the screenplay, but the film has his signature foul-mouthed dialogue and a fast rhythm that Rob Lowe is … not comfortable with. (It’s weird, because Lowe later proved to be very good at zippy Sorkin dialogue, but the Mamet does not work for him.) <i>About Last Night</i> follows the basic plot points of the play: two people start dating, move in together too soon, and fight a bunch. This would be a good time to mention that …</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-794832434fbc59414325e54991ca0a07-5-0-0@published data-word-count=141><span><b>This is not a comedy.</b><br>Like, not at all. Jim Belushi, who plays Lowe’s best friend, yells “tits and ass” a lot while getting drunk, but that is as much comic relief as you will find in the 1986 version. It’s a movie about the <i>complexities</i> of a relationship, which means watching Rob Lowe and Demi Moore have a lot of sex and then argue about whether to buy a turkey or a ham for Thanksgiving. (For some reason, Demi Moore wants to buy a ham. She is almost always right in this movie, but not about the ham.) Then — spoiler alert — they break up on New Year’s, and Rob Lowe delivers the “get out” speech from some tacky red design chair. Demi Moore tries her best to cry. Pro tip: Don’t watch the original movie on Valentine’s Day.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/45c/b11/9073939e2900f06d4943ecd5a1a64273fb-12-about-last-night-1.rsquare.w400.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-794832434fbc59414325e54991ca0a07-7-0-0@published data-word-count=50><span><strong>They really do have a lot of sex, though.</strong><br>And they’re very naked, for a large portion of the movie. There’s one particularly long sex montage with breasts and blooming flowers (literally, but also figuratively) and a bike wheel (Demi Moore: having sex near spinning objects since 1986). Also, this happens:</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/287/8a0/c2a5639791449b8f80f4693e763afcf443-robundies.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-794832434fbc59414325e54991ca0a07-9-0-0@published data-word-count=43><span>Then both Rob Lowe and Demi Moore prance into the kitchen butt-naked. Rob Lowe also does all household chores — setting the dinner table, sensually making pasta — with his shirt 100 percent unbuttoned.

There is also a female counterpart, played by a very young and very permed Elizabeth Perkins. They hate each other, and not in a meet-cute, end-up-married type of way. It is mostly a competition to see who can make various social settings (softball games, second dates, St. Patrick’s Day) the most uncomfortable. (One assumes that the Kevin Hart version will be funnier.)</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-794832434fbc59414325e54991ca0a07-12-0-0@published data-word-count=7><span><strong>Demi Moore’s silk shirt game is unstoppable.</strong><br></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/bfd/eec/55655c2f25028165f2320d579864be8ffd-12-about-last-night-5.h473.w710.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-794832434fbc59414325e54991ca0a07-14-0-0@published data-word-count=6><span>(Yes, this is a different shirt.)<br></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/287/8a0/c2a5639791449b8f80f4693e763afcf443-robundies.w710.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-794832434fbc59414325e54991ca0a07-16-0-0@published data-word-count=25><span>Her boots are great, too, and her overalls, and her front-clasp bra.
