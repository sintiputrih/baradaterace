Although Jada Pinkett Smith has remained notably mum regarding the violent altercation at the 2022 Oscars (save for a cryptic Instagram post) it's reported that she isn't too pleased with her husband's behavior, either. A source told Us Weekly that Pinkett Smith wishes that Smith had not gotten physical with Rock. &#34;It was in the heat of the moment and it was him overreacting. He knows that, she knows that."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He knows that, she knows that. They're in agreement that he overreacted," the source alleged. Still, the source is adamant that Pinkett Smith is taking a page straight out of country singer Tammy Wynette's playbook. "She's a strong woman, an opinionated woman and she can fight her own battles. But she will stand by him," the source claimed. "They protect their family. They're all about their family and their kids. They've done everything to build this life for themselves. They are very much protected in their own lives and do the absolute best they can to protect their loved ones."</p><p>Perhaps the famous couple can duke it out on another episode of Pinkett Smith's talk show series, "Red Table Talk."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWpiZ4N0e8KhqaKrXae8pLfSZqatoJWneqO%2Bzq2fnqpdqLavt9Jmn6KrXamypsDHZqCnrJ9ixKq4y2aqpqGknXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
