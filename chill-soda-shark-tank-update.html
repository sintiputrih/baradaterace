What’s the update on Chill Soda? The Shark Tank brand was billed as a “healthy soda revolution,” offering carbonated beverages with less sugar and fewer calories than the usual vending-machine offerings.
In Shark Tank’s first season, Chill Soda found a big fan in investor Barbara Corcoran. “I love having a soda I can actually feel good about giving to my kids, and best of all, my kids loving drinking it,” she says in a quote on the Chill Soda website."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Mackey came on the ABC reality show seeking an investment of $50,000 for 10 percent equity in his company. He told the sharks that Chill Soda is organic and low-glycemic and features anti-oxidants but no high-fructose. “But the best thing? It tastes like regular soda,” he added. “It is good.”</p><p>Better yet, the sharks seem to like the taste of the Chill Soda samples Mackey handed out.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>But then Mackey didn’t know the answer when Shark Tank star <a href=#>Kevin O’Leary</a> asked him what the “ultimate leverage of success for all players in the beverage industry” is.
