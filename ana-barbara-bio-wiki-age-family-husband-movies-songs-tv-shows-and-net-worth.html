She migrated to the United States, Los Angeles area with her three children.</p><p>She released the stand-alone banda single “Tu Ingratitud”, a 1993 Los Bukis cover composed by Marco Antonio Solís. A music video was released in July 2012 and quickly reached over three million views on YouTube. “Tu Ingratitud” peaked at number one in Mexico and top 20 in the United States and South America.</p><p>The record soon reached international popularity and became Bárbara’s return to music charts and touring.

In January 2014, Bárbara announced the Yo Soy La Mujer: Celebrando 20 Años de Trayectoria tour in honor of her 20-year musical career, she stated that the tour symbolized the end of an era and the beginning of a new chapter in her professional life.</p><p>The tour kicked off internationally in La Paz, Bolivia.

In July 2010, she was involved in a car accident in Cancún that left a 79-year-old woman dead; the incident sparked a media circus.</p><p>Authorities arrested Bárbara’s driver (bodyguard and family friend). Some eyewitnesses, however, speculated that it was Bárbara who was driving. She denied the accusations and any wrongdoing.</p><p>Due to immense media pressure, Bárbara granted network Televisa an exclusive interview where she broke down in tears and offered the victim’s family an apology about the accident.</p><p>She also stated that on-scene police authorities allowed her to leave the scene because they had apprehended her driver. To add fuel to the fire, the victim’s daughter used several media outlets to blast Bárbara and presume that it was she that was driving.</p><p>Bárbara was exonerated after Mexican authorities found no evidence that could have linked her behind the wheel. She faced civil charges for being the registered owner of the vehicle involved in the accident.</p><p>In December 2010, Mexico’s CNDH (Human Rights National Committee) recommended that the governor and Municipal President of Quintana Roo review the case after a petition was filed by the victim’s family claiming investigative fallacies.</p><p>During the appeal, Bárbara was called to re-testify but was found innocent of any wrongdoing. Munguía (driver) was free on bail while the case was pending, but in October 2011 he pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter.</p><p>In early 2012, he was sentenced to two years in prison; he was released in 2014. On February 3, 2011, Bárbara was involved in another car accident in Cancún, Quintana Roo. Officials in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo say the singer was driving a Porsche Cayenne that hit the back of another vehicle at a stop light.</p><p>Traffic officer Abraham Coutino said “no one was injured” and “the singer’s insurance covered all damages.” Bárbara was highly criticized by the media once again but asked the general public not to believe the exaggerated reports over the minor fender bender accident.</p><h2 id=h-ana-barbara-awards-and-achievements><span class=ez-toc-section id=ana-barbara-awards-and-achievements></span><span>Ana Bárbara Awards and Achievements</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bárbara is the recipient Latin Grammy’s, Lo Nuestro Awards, Juventud Awards, and Oye Awards.</p><p>Her former record label Fonovisa said, “These recognitions are milestone accomplishments in [her] career that has spanned for more than a decade of uninterrupted success in the United States, México, and Latin America.”</p><p>She has also been awarded four Lo Nuestro Awards for Regional Mexican Female Artist of the Year, with a total of 9 nominations since her debut.

Awards (Mexico’s version of the Grammy Awards).</p><p>In September 2012, she was crowned queen of the LGBT community in Los Angeles, California, as well as in Atlanta, Georgia in 2014, and in San Francisco on January 1, 2015.</p><p>By the fall of 2012, she was honored for her 20-year music trajectory by the Regional Mexican Music award show Premios de la Radio. In a career spanning over 20 years, she has sold over 8 million albums, singles, and videos worldwide, making her one of the few female interpreters of Regional Mexican music to garner an international following that extends beyond México and the United States.” To celebrate her first career recognition, Bárbara performed a medley of signature songs: “Lo Busque,” “Como Me Haces Falta,” “Tu Ingratitud,” and “Bandido”. She also celebrated the special ceremony by performing a duet of “Te Voy Olvidar” with Jenni Rivera (only one month before Rivera’s death).</p><p>In 2013, she was nominated for Female Artist of the Year at Premios de la Radio and the Mexican Billboard Music Awards.</p><p>In 2014, she was nominated for Female Artist of the Year at Lo Nuestro Awards, Premios de la Radio, and People En Español’s Entertainment Awards.</p><p>In 2015, Ana Bárbara was nominated for Regional Mexican Female Artist of the Year at Univision’s Lo Nuestro Awards.</p><p>By 2015, Ana Barbara reached over 75 million combined YouTube views of her music videos and special televised performances.
