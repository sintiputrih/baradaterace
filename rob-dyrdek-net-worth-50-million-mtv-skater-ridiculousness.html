What people might not realize about Rob Dyrdek&nbsp;is that he’s so much more than that goofy guy on television.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Not only has he had a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">few TV shows on MTV</a>, but he’s also dipped into the big screen too,&nbsp; acting, producing, and even writing movies and documentaries. Of course, Rob wouldn’t be anywhere without his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">professional skateboarding</a> career, which was what launched him into superstardom in the first place. Skateboarding kicked off his career, as he’s had a number of sponsors and later on helped build skateparks and a skateboarding competition.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Rob is worth over $50 million dollars. So, how exactly did he get so rich?</span></p><h2 id=he-s-a-professional-skateboarder><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>He's A Professional Skateboarder</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>We all know Rob Dyrdek the reality TV star, however, it’s easy to forget how his whole career got started. Rob was actually a professional skateboarder before anything else. He began skating when he was just 11 years old. He was so good that he was quick to go pro, as he left school at 16 to pursue his professional career.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MTV's 'Punk'd' Makes A Comeback...

He was sponsored by the brand for two decades, the contract ending in 2016. Rob wore the sponsorship well, as you could almost always spot him wearing something DC, whether it be a hat, shirt, or even shoes, Rob always repped DC.</span></p><h2 id=he-starred-in-rob-and-big><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>He Starred In&nbsp;Rob And Big</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Rob made his major TV debut in 2006 when he starred in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his own reality show</a>, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Rob and Big</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. The show centered around Rob and his bodyguard and best friend Christopher Boykin. Airing for three seasons, the show came to an end in 2008. </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Rob and Big</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> really kicked off Rob’s television career.</span></p><h2 id=he-also-starred-in-fantasy-factory><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>He Also Starred In&nbsp;Fantasy Factory</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>When </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Rob and Big</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> came to a close, Rob started up another show the following year on MTV called </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Rob Dyrdek’s Fantasy Factory</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. The show was another reality show that followed Rob and his friends as they converted an old warehouse into a playhouse with skateboard ramps, basketball hoops, and a giant foam pit.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-wrote-produced-and-starred-in-a-movie><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>He Wrote, Produced And Starred In A Movie</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>In 2009, Rob decided that he wanted to take things to an even bigger screen when he came up with the idea for the movie </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Sweet Dreams</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. Not only did Rob star in the movie about skateboarding, of course, but he also wrote the script for the movie and produced it. Rob really is a triple threat!</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 MTV Reality Shows From The 2000s We'd Love To See Make A Comeback</a></span></p><h2 id=he-was-featured-in-two-video-games><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He Was Featured In Two Video Games</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>From skateboarding to the small screen, and even the big screen, Rob even dabbled in the video game world. No, he didn’t have his own video game, however, he was featured in not one, but two skateboarding games, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Skate</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Skate 2</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.

He had an even bigger role in the movie </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Righteous Kill</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> where he had a role alongside some famous names like Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. It was a psychological thriller that did fairly well at the box office.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-starred-in-ridiculousness><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>He Starred In&nbsp;Ridiculousness</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>With two successful shows on MTV, of course the network was willing to work with Rob on another show, this time, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Ridiculousness</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The show made its debut</a> on MTV in 2011 where Rob plays a slew of funny videos from the internet all while making comments about them alongside his panel and celebrity guests.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 MTV Shows From The '90s That Need A Reboot</a></span></p><h2 id=he-helped-create-skate-parks><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He Helped Create Skate Parks</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>We all know by now how much skateboarding is near and dear to Rob’s heart. That’s why he decided that he wanted to build a number of skateparks for kids to have a safe place to skateboard and have fun in. There are a lot of laws about skateboarding, and by building parks just for them, Rob can ensure future skaters are safe while doing so.</span></p><h2 id=he-started-street-league-skateboarding-competition><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Started Street League Skateboarding Competition</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>By now it seems like Rob has an endless list of things that he’s been working on, but the list doesn't quite end there. He’s the founder of the Street League Skateboarding skateboard competition enterprise. It’s become quite an international event as it’s shown on ESPN in 198 countries.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-was-in-a-documentary><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He Was In A Documentary</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Rob also ensured that the league gave back to those in need, as they’ve partnered with the Boys and Girls Club of America where they construct skate parks. He made sure to capture all of this in a documentary titled </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Motivation</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival.</span></p><h2 id=he-produced-a-number-of-shows><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He Produced A Number Of Shows</span></h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>As if that wasn’t enough, to top it all off, Rob is also a producer.
