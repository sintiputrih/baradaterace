(Experimental Audio Research) – the two projects have existed in parallel, and recordings under both names occasionally only feature Kember. He has occasionally performed live under both monikers, most recently in 2008-11 as Spectrum, touring as a band in America and Europe.<br>Kember has played and collaborated with a number of artists, including Stereolab and Yo La Tengo.<br>Kember has also collaborated with other artists as a producer. He performed production duties on MGMT’s 2010 album Congratulations and Panda Bear’s albums Tomboy and Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=music-career></span><span id=Music_career>Music career</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=spacemen-3></span><span id=Spacemen_3>Spacemen 3</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=sonic-boom></span><span id=Sonic_Boom>Sonic Boom</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kember’s first solo album, <i>Spectrum</i>, was recorded in 1989 while Spacemen 3 were still a going concern, and featured the other members of the group.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=spectrum></span><span id=Spectrum>Spectrum</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kember recruited new musicians for the group Spectrum in 1991. Initial Spectrum releases carried on from the sound of late-period Spacemen 3, featuring conventional songs and a regular band. First single “How You Satisfy Me” was an original composition reminiscent of 1960s garage bands, based as it was upon the Chip Taylor-penned pop hit “Can’t Let Go”. 1992’s <i>Soul Kiss (Glide Divine)</i> album was split between songs and longer experimental pieces featuring drones and repetition, and <i>Highs, Lows and Heavenly Blows</i> (1994) was also mainly song-oriented. Kember has occasionally collaborated with Jessamine and The Silver Apples under the Spectrum name.</p><p>Since 1996 the Spectrum name has been used for Kember’s solo work, sometimes with Pete Bain from the original Spacemen 3 lineup and recording engineer/musician Alf Hardy. The music made with Bain and Hardy was often in the same vein as E.A.R., reflecting an increased interest in vintage analogue synthesizers, especially those made by EMS. After issuing 1997’s <i>Forever Alien</i> album, there were no further releases of new material under the Spectrum moniker until 2008’s <i>Indian Giver</i> collaboration with Jim Dickinson. Kember has also worked with Füxa’s Randall Nieman.</p><p>During 2008-11, a four-piece Spectrum toured extensively in America and Europe. This included providing main support for the 2009 reformation tour of My Bloody Valentine, and a performance at the All Tomorrow’s Parties festival in May 2011. An EP, <i>War Sucks</i>, was released in 2009.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=ear></span><span id=E.A.R.>E.A.R.</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Although the first E.A.R. album to be released (<i>Mesmerised</i>, 1994) was Kember on his own, the initial intention of E.A.R. was to record experimental “soundscape” music with collaborators. The second album, <i>Beyond the Pale</i> (1996), which was actually the first to be recorded, in 1992, included Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine, Kevin Martin and AMM’s Eddie Prévost. The album was remixed by German musician Thomas Köner in 1997, and released as <i>The Köner Experiment</i>. Prévost also appeared on <i>Phenomena 256</i> (1996) and <i>Millennium Music</i> (1998), both of which included a larger group of musicians. <i>Data Rape</i> (1998) was recorded solely by Kember, using the technique of circuit bending, which he continued to use on the <i>Vibrations</i> EP (2000) and <i>Continuum</i> album (2001). The latter two releases were made with assistance from Delia Derbyshire, formerly of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, who also had a track named after her on the Spectrum album <i>Forever Alien</i>. The most recent E.A.R. release is <i>Worn to a Shadow</i> (2005).</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=other-musical-collaborations></span><span id=Other_musical_collaborations>Other musical collaborations</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kember has also played and collaborated with Birmingham band Magnétophone who were signed to 4AD records, performing with them live on European tours between 2006 & 2007 (he also managed them during this period), The Field Trip, Stereolab, Yo La Tengo, Britta Phillips and Dean Wareham, Cheval Sombre, Cloudland Canyon, and Pat Fish of The Jazz Butcher, The Fields of Hay and with the Italian band Julie’s Haircut.</p><p>2006 saw Kember mentor The Flowers of Hell through the creation of their self titled debut, mixing and performing on a track and returning to do the same on the group’s 2009 Come Hell Or High Water album.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=work-as-a-producer></span><span id=Work_as_a_Producer>Work as a Producer</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kember produced Blair 1523’s debut album, <i>Beautiful Debris</i>. He remixed Britta Phillips and Dean Wareham’s <i>L’Avventura</i> album, releasing <i>Sonic Souvenirs</i> in 2003. In 2010, Kember undertook superervisory production on MGMT’s second album, titled <i>Congratulations</i>;, in 2011, he mixed and mastered Panda Bear’s fourth album, <i>Tomboy</i>, in 2012 he produced TEEN’s record In Limbo. In 2015, he co-produced Panda Bear’s fifth album, <i>Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper</i>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=discography></span><span id=Discography.5B1.5D.5B2.5D>Discography</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=as-sonic-boom></span><span id=As_Sonic_Boom>As Sonic Boom</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><b>Albums:</b></p><ul><li><i>Spectrum</i> (1990)</li></ul><p><b>Singles/EPs:</b></p><ul><li><i>Angel</i> (1989)</li><li><i>Octaves/Tremolos</i> (1990)</li><li><i>Drone Dream</i> (1991)</li><li><i>Mechanical Man</i> (1994)</li><li><i>The Sundowner</i> (2000)</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=as-spectrum></span><span id=As_Spectrum>As Spectrum</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><b>Albums:</b></p><ul><li><i>Soul Kiss (Glide Divine)</i> (1992)</li><li><i>Highs, Lows and Heavenly Blows</i> (1994)</li><li><i>Forever Alien</i> (1997)</li><li><i>A Lake Of Teardrops [Spectrum & Silver Apples LP]</i> (1999) (with Silver Apples)</li></ul><p>Compilations and special releases:</p><ul><li><i>What Came Before After</i> (1994) [compilation]</li><li><i>A Lake of Teardrops</i> (1999)</li><li><i>Live Chronicles Vol. 1</i> (2001) [live recordings]</li><li><i>Live Chronicles Vol. 2</i> (2001) [live recordings]</li><li><i>Refractions: Thru the Rhythms of Time 1989-1997</i> (2004) [compilation]</li><li><i>Indian Giver: Spectrum meets Cpt.
