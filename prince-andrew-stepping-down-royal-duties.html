The queen's third child and the eighth in line to the throne announced in a statement today that he will "step back from royal duties for the foreseeable future"—it's a move that was approved by the sovereign. The message was shared on the royal family's official social media profiles.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The news comes just days after the Duke of York <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-50451953 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="sat down with the BBC" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">sat down with the BBC</a> to address his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was charged with sex trafficking this summer before he died in jail.
