She also told the magazine that she’s gone to her boyfriend for acting advice ahead of her AHS debut.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Kaia-Gerber-Dating-Jacob-Elordi-Love-Is-Really-Seeing-Someone-002.jpg><p>“He’s a great person for me to go to because he’s gone to drama school and has years of experience that I don’t have,” she explained. “So I’m like, ‘Oh, I’m definitely going to be using you as a resource.'”</p><p>AHS cocreator <a href=#><strong>Ryan Murphy</strong></a> added that Kaia’s famous parents didn’t have anything to do with his choice to cast her in the long-running horror anthology series.</p><p>“She had one of the best auditions I’ve ever seen,” he said. “I was so surprised that she didn’t call in any favors. You could tell that she’d just worked really hard and really got in the trenches. She wanted a challenge.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Though Elordi, who was previously linked to <a href=#><strong>Joey King</strong></a> and <strong><a href=#>Zendaya</a></strong>, is known primarily for his roles in movies including The Kissing Booth, he also has a modeling background that helped give him an opening with Kaia.</p><p>“It’s actually crazy how much they have in common,” the insider explained to Us. “It was like the universe brought them together! They’re both models, modeled for Calvin Klein — very into fashion, of course. They love going shopping together and even working out together. They’re truly some of the kindest people you will meet.”</p><p><a href=#>Prior to her romance with the actor</a>, Kaia dated <a href=#><strong>Pete Davidson</strong></a> from October 2019 to January 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmZmWeqix0Zucq2WTpLqusc2tqmannmLAtbHAnbBmopGYvKN5xKWmq5yZYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
