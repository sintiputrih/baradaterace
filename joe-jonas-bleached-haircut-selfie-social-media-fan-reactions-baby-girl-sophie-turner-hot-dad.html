With his new haircut, Joe has opted to go from a Mr Tall, Dark and Handsome into what fans are deeming a Slim Shady-inspired look.&nbsp;Joe shared a selfie on Instagram on August 20 which shows the 31-year-old 'Cake By The Ocean' singer with a frosty trim and just the emoji "üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" in his caption.</p><p>Fans were quick to respond with humorous comments. One fan says, "Will the real slim shady please stand up," referring to rapper Eminem. Another reference included ex-One Direction member Zayn Malik: "Pack it up Zayn Malik," wrote a fan. One supportive fan found Joe's look appealing, saying, "HES A HOT DAD." See the photo <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>Over on Twitter, fans were also loving his new haircut, saying, "he's so hot" and "he lookin kinda cute."</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>he lookin kinda cute</p>‚Äî alex üßöüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (@alexjergi) <a href=#>August 21, 2020</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>One fan wrote, "imagine having a nice face that suits literally any hair color."</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>imagine having a nice face that suits literally any hair color</p>‚Äî alex ‚õì (@lowkeyalejandro) <a href=#>August 21, 2020</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>While Joe and his 'Game of Thrones' star wife, Sophie Turner, kept her pregnancy hush-hush, the couple did announce the birth of their baby girl last month through a representative.&nbsp;According to Digital Spy, the spokesperson for the couple shared that Joe and Sophie were "delighted to announce" the happy news.</p><p>When it comes to his music outside the Jonas Brothers, Joe has been quiet. His debut solo album 'Fastlife' released back in 2011. His latest single as a solo artiste arrived in 2018 which was a collaboration with DJ and producer Jonas Blue, titled 'I See Love'.&nbsp;</p><p>Joe's band DNCE in which he is frontman has also been fairly quiet. Their self-titled album released in 2016 and had a re-issue in 2017. Their latest project is the EP 'People to People' which released in 2018. However, fans were ecstatic to hear that the Jonas Brothers made a comeback last year with their album 'Happiness Begins' and have been keeping up to date with new music in 2020 as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/25b516da-937b-43f9-9973-8d6e8a2f0a28.jpg><p>Meanwhile, Sophie Turner revealed in March that she was "deeply" missing 'Game of Thrones' and would "go back to it in a heartbeat" after the series wrapped up last year.&nbsp;"I miss everything [about it]," she said. "I really, deeply, deeply miss it. "I miss the costumes. I miss the set. I miss the feeling that I got when I walked onto set in my costume, and that was incredibly empowering. I miss the people. I miss everything. I would go back to it in a heartbeat."</p><p>But the upcoming spin-offs aren't getting much love either. Earlier this year, she said,&nbsp; "I don't want to be a part of it. Unless they give me the big bucks, I'm not doing it!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoop%2Baequ7zZqqZpqcmq6ktMSdZKGZmaewtsCMrJylnpmaerS7wqKYpWWdmrGqrYyfmKdlopqupMDIqKWsZZKWr7p5xqKppWWjpL2ptcRmq66qnpq%2FbrTOrWSdmZQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
