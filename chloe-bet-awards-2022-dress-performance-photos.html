All three songs are set to appear on Chlöe’s upcoming debut album, which she said was “90 percent done” in August 2021. However, she has yet to announce plans for a release.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/chloe-bailey-BET-Awards-2022-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>In addition to performing as a solo artist at the BET Awards in 2022, Chlöe is also nominated four times at the show. She and Halle scored another nomination for Best Group, while Chlöe is up for Video of the Year, Best Female R&B/Pop Artist and the BET Her Award. Chloe x Halle has been nominated at the show four times in the past, although they’ve never taken home an award during the ceremony.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In 2021, Chlöe walked the BET Awards red carpet without her sister and served as a presenter during the broadcast. She wore a see-through, black mesh dress ,revealing her black lingerie underneath. Her look was complete with curly hair that was pulled back into a messy updo. Chlöe and Halle attended the event together in 2016, 2017 and 2018, as well. Even though Chloe is venturing out as a solo artist these days, though, she still performs with her sister. Most recently, they took the stage in mid-June at a festival in Washington D.C.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e5FvZpygnKSybq7ErWSar5GnsbR5kWlpa2WUp7K0v4ypnKuen6e6orrCnmSpoJ%2BpvLR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
