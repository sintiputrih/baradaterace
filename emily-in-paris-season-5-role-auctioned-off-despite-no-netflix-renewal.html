(Emily in Paris season 4 is set to arrive on Netflix on August 15 with Part 2 dropping on September 12.)</p><p>While the prize sounds like a dream, Netflix hasn’t greenlit season 5 yet, according to the outlet, and despite Harlow and Jackson’s optimistic filming update, the auction description has been updated to reflect the realities of the show’s unknown future.</p><p>The official amfAR auction website reads, “As part of the walk-on role, the winning bidder will have the opportunity to spend a day on set in Paris during filming, contingent upon season 5 pickup.” Variety reported the original language in the auction booklet did not include “contingent” and indicated season 5 was already in the works.</p><p>The fate of season 5 is still up in the air, but fans are anxiously awaiting the season 4 premiere after nearly two years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2-Emily-in-Paris-Season-5-Role-Auctioned-Off-in-Cannes-Despite-No-Renewal-From-Netflix-Yet.jpg><p>During the dramatic season 3 finale, which aired in December 2022, Gabriel (<strong>Lucas Bravo</strong>) and Camille (<strong>Camille Razat</strong>) break up at the altar due to his feelings for Emily (<strong>Lily Collins</strong>). After Alfie (<strong>Lucien Laviscount</strong>) finds out about the situation, he ends his relationship with Emily, and she finds her way back to Gabriel.</p><p>“There’s a lot more story to tell here and we’re not wrapping things up anytime soon,” creator <strong>Darren Star</strong> told E! News that same month. “I feel like we’re all creatively feeling like we’re in the middle of something not heading towards the end.”</p><p>The show was greenlit for season 4 at the same time as season 3 back in January 2020. In June 2023, Variety confirmed that production on season 4 was delayed amid the WGA writers’ strike.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As far as whether Emily and Gabriel will get their happily ever after, Star, 62, admitted it won’t be that simple for the duo.</p><p>“They are star-crossed lovers, they really are,” Starr told Deadline in December 2022. “And I think that a big question to think about the next season is, Emily didn’t come to Paris for romance, she came for a job, and I think they’re both in a different, more mature place in their lives, Emily and Gabriel, and definitely a more complicated place.”</p><p>Collins, 35, teased that there will be an “unexpected twist” during season 4, saying during a Netflix Tudum event in June 2023, “Emily is going to have to decide if everything she’s ever wanted is really what she needs.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJymoZyueqq6jKmYq6GjYsCmrdKopWZtXae8rbGMmqycrJmku6awjKidn2WUmsCxtdOeZKenXaOytbLLoq9mqpWjsrity2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
