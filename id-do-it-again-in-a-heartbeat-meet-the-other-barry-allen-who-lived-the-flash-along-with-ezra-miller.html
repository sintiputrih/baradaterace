The director explained:</p><p>“We needed someone that physically resembled Ezra because there are many shots where we only replace the head. … The other part we needed was chemistry with Ezra. Ezra was very much part of the election, let’s say, of choosing the actor. Another thing was the adaptability and the ability to mimic Ezra’s mannerisms. That was a job that Ed took very seriously, and he just excelled at it.”</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>Producer Barbara Muschietti, Andy’s sister, thought Wade was crucial to building a sibling element between the film’s two Barrys. She said, “It was hard when we were done because Ezra and Ed played together for basically 138 days. It was like watching twins separate.”</p><p data-characters=424 data-current-count=716 data-injectable=true>As far as how they shot it, the director explained that Miller often played the central and slightly older Barry during the shoot, but if the younger Barry had more screen time, Miller would pivot to that. Then, a few months later, Miller acted out the parts they didn’t originally play inside the so-called “volume,” which is a massive LED screen used on projects like Disney Plus’ <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mandalorian</a>.</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=268 data-injectable=false>According to Muschietti, those later performances were captured after the original scenes were fully edited, noting, “We needed those scenes to be edited to know what performances we were using and condense the work that we were doing with volume capture.”</p><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=613 data-injectable=false>It sounds like none of that would have been possible without the dedication of Wade across months of shooting. Muschietti called him “an incredible actor,” so let’s hope some of the praise being given to Miller for anchoring the emotional core of a pretty insane movie will find its way to the other half of the Flash equation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooJ1llKR6qsCMmp6aoZ5itq95wGafnpmiqa%2BmrdNmpJ6dpGLBqbGMqKuhnaJir6K%2B0bJkmqScmrtuw8eoZKWhppqxbsDHnmSfpJGotW6ty6iloGWnnsGpecSzqZplnZ65rbHRaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
