There are pedophiles sitting in offices, bars working their way towards being absolutely non-rapey, people with mental illnesses turning into gay Jesus, and confused teens doing the utmost to rebel.</p><p>But none of this made the list of the most outrageous things the show has come up with because the one episode featured the youngest Gallagher - Liam, who is only eight or nine years old - admitting to having sex. So, did he really gets a girl pregnant? Well, let's find it out together.</p><h2>No, Liam Gallagher Did Not Get the Girl Pregnant: Shameless Update!</h2><p>Liam Fergus Beircheart Gallagher is the <a href=# rel=noopener>youngest</a> of the Gallagher siblings in Shameless who was a recurring character until becoming a prominent character in Season 8 and remaining so in subsequent seasons. As we can see in the show's 9th season, Liam was accused of getting a girl pregnant. But, although he did have sex with a girl,&nbsp;he did not make the girl pregnant.</p><p>It all began in the show's 9th season episode 5 when Liam was initially bullied at public school because he came from a private school, he uses his intelligence to his advantage, bribing a boy with work if he protects him from a mean girl <a href=# rel=noopener>named</a> Sissy and other threats. Liam is eventually allowed to proceed to sixth grade, much to his delight.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/06/liam-gallagher-did-not-make-the-girl-pregnant.jpg alt="Liam Gallagher did not make the girl pregnant. celebsindepth.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Liam Gallagher did not make the girl pregnant.<br>Image Source: MEAWW</strong></p><p>Later, Sissy, who appears to come onto Liam in a closet, approaches him soon after. Liam is perplexed by what has occurred, although enjoying it, as evidenced by his statement to Lip. However, after informing him that she is allegedly pregnant with his kid, Sissy decides to move in with him that night. Fortunately, Carl and Debbie witnessed this strange scene and informed Liam that, owing to the timing, he did not impregnate Sissy. Intervening, the sibling informs Lip and kicks her out by drugging her and transporting her to a clinic.</p><h2>Why Did Emmy Rossum Leave Shameless?</h2><p>Contractual issues among the Shameless cast were reported ahead of the show's eighth season's production. Despite contractually receiving equal billing, <strong>Emmy Rossum </strong>(<a href=# rel=noopener>@emmy</a>), who played Fiona Gallager, reported making significantly less money than costar <strong>William H. Macy</strong>. According to Variety, Rossum asked for not only equal pay for Macy but also a raise to compensate for years of unfair wages. In a now-deleted tweet, Rossum later said, “Playing Fiona Gallagher has been one of the great privileges of my life. I’m so happy to continue with my Shameless family! Back to work in May!” confirming her involvement with Shameless Season 8.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/06/emmy-rossum-left-shameless-to-cite-her-exit-as-an-opportunity-to-move-on-to-other-projects.jpg alt="Emmy Rossum left Shameless to cite her exit as an opportunity to move on to other projects. celebsindepth.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Emmy Rossum left Shameless to cite her exit as an opportunity to move on to other projects.<br>Image Source: Us Weekley</strong></p><p>However, the apparent resolve did not endure long. Later, Emmy Rossum confirmed her resignation from Shameless in 2018, after participating in Seasons 8 and 9. She cited her departure as a chance to move on to other endeavors in a thoughtful Facebook post. She <a href=# rel=noopener>stated</a>,</p><p><strong>The opportunity to play Fiona has been a gift. There are few characters — female or otherwise — as layered and dynamic. She is a mother lion, fierce, flawed and sexually liberated. She is injured, vulnerable, but will never give up. She is living in an economic depression but refuses to be depressed. She is resourceful. She is loyal. She is brave. I knew it the second I read the pilot script, this was different, this was special.</strong></p><p>Later, Rossum detailed the profound memories she made on the Shameless set in her post before somberly saying goodbye to the show, saying,&nbsp;"I know you will continue on without me, for now. There is much more Gallagher story to be told. I will always be rooting for my family. Try not to think of me as gone, just think of me as moving down the block.”</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGiqoZmdmrmmv9Jmo6KZnWK0psDSZp6iqpxivbOxxqeYp6xf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
