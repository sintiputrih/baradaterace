Christine McVie is most famous for being a member of English/American rock group, Fleetwood Mac. She is considered one of the best songwriters of all time. Some of the most-famous McVie songs include “Don’t Stop,” “You Make Loving Fun” and “Little Lies.” The first two appeared on the band’s 1977 album “Rumours” which went on to sell more than 40 million copies. To date, Fleetwood Mac has sold over 150 million albums worldwide and they continue to be one of the highest-grossing touring acts in the world. When the band released a greatest hits album, Christine was the sole or primary songwriter on half of the tracks.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life></span><strong>Early Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Born in a small English village in Cumbria, McVie had her first taste of music at the age of four. She soon was learning piano and at the age of eleven was already studying classical music. While studying for a teacher degree, McVie joined a band called Sounds of Blues that had been formed by two friends. By the time she graduated from school, the band split up.</p><p>McVie’s luck was about to change when her friends formed another band and asked her to join. Their first release, It’s OK With Me Baby, was written and sung by McVie. She was a lead vocalist for the single, I’d Rather Go Blind, which was a big hit in the UK. McVie received a Melody Maker Award for Best Female Vocalist in 1969 and 1970. In 1969, McVie left Chicken Shack and later joined Fleetwood Mac. McVie’s piano work can be heard on the band’s second album, Mr. Wonderful (1968). She also provided backing vocals for the fourth album, Kiln House (1970).</p><p>Before she joined Fleetwood Mac, McVie- known as Christine Perfect at the time – released a solo album (self-titled) in 1970. The album was re-released in 1976 as The Legendary Christine Perfect album. When Fleetwood Mac founder Peter Green left the band in 1970, McVie became the heartbeat of the band and was responsible for the band’s string of greatest hits. The 1977 album, Rumours, became one of the best selling albums of all time. The 1979 album, Tusk, produced multiple top 20 hits in the US and UK.</p><p>By the mid eighties, McVie left the band to produce another solo album, which created some moderately successful singles. She rejoined Fleetwood Mac to record the 1987 album Tango in the Night – which became the band’s greatest hit since Rumours. The hit singles included Little Lies and Everywhere. The nineties did not bring the same success to the band. McVie retired from Fleetwood Mac after her father died. Despite her departure, she remained loyal to the band. At the turn the turn of the century, McVie maintains a low profile. In 2004, she produced her third solo album with the help of her guitarist nephew. In 2013, she rejoined Fleetwood Mac.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=live-nation-earnings></span><strong>Live Nation Earnings</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In October 2018 we learned some of the financial inner-workings of today’s Fleetwood Mac thanks to a lawsuit filed by on-again-off-again member Lindsey Buckingham. Buckingham sued his former bandmates after he was abruptly removed from the group’s 2018-2019 Live Nation tour. The lawsuit claimed that according to terms of their deal with Live Nation, each band member would receive $200,000 per show over 60 shows, for a total payout of $12 million. The amount could reach as high as $14 million depending on various attendance milestones and additional dates added down the road. Three months later the lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount. Buckingham released a statement saying:</p><p>“We’ve all signed off on something. I’m happy enough with it. I’m not out there trying to twist the knife at all. I’m trying to look at this with some level of compassion, some level of wisdom.“</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=catalog-sale></span><strong>Catalog Sale</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In August 2021 Christine announced she had sold the rights to her publishing royalties to music investment company Hipgnosis. The sale amount was not released but several months earlier, Stevie Nicks sold her catalog rights – which included a number of solo hits – for $100 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJuYp7a0wMinnGalk6u2pr%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jJugqJ%2Bilr2pxYycmKudlad6osPAq5usZZaWsLV5wKebZqSZm7Juv9OoqbJn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
