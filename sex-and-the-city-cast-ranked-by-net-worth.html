Fortunately for those who don't have HBO, viewers can relive the iconic show (or see it for the very first time) on <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a>. This is because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sex and the City debuted on the streaming service</a> in April 2024.</p><p>While Warner Bros. Discovery reached the deal with Netflix, it is currently unknown as to whether the cast of Sex and the City financially benefited.

Eigenberg is by far best known for his role in the Sex and the City franchise, so it's safe to say that the majority of <strong>his $6 million net worth</strong> comes from that. However, it is also beloved from the One Chicago franchise, where he played Christopher Herrmann. This includes major appearances in Chicago Fire, Chicago P.D., Chicago Med, and Chicago Justice.</p><p>However, Celebrity Net Worth also lists a number of other projects that contributed to his net worth.

But there's no way that all of this money came from his role as Charlotte's lawyer and second husband, Harry in the Sex and the City franchise. In fact, most TV watchers may know him best as Hank Moody's agent and best friend in Californication alongside David Duchovny.

Just like Cynthia Nixon, Davis has played her Sex and the City character in the original series, both movies and the sequel series. While she's been in movies like Couples Retreat and The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D, Davis' acting resume is far smaller than her co-stars. Although she is famous for her guest appearances on both Friends and Seinfeld.

While everyone and their dog knows about the feud between her and her Sex and the City co-star, Sarah Jessica Parker, there was a huge amount of hope that they would bury the hatchet for the reprise. That, of course, didn't end up happening. But Cattrall has more than enough money to sit back on instead of playing Samantha once more. According to Celebrity Net Worth, <strong>Kim Cattrall is worth $40 million</strong>, mostly from her role in the original series and the two feature films.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Sarah-Jessica-Parker-and-Kim-Cattrall-in-Sex-and-the-City-via-TODAY.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Sarah Jessica Parker Is 'No Longer Comfortable' Working With Kim Cattrall</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Sarah Jessica Parker has been candid about her feelings toward her former co-star Kim Cattrall.</span><p>According to Stylecaster, <strong>Kim Cattrall was making $350,000 per episode</strong> in the later season of Sex in the City.

She was also paid somewhere close to $7 million for the first movie and $10 million for the second.</p><p>According to IMDb, here are some of Cattrall's other famous projects:</p><ul><li>The Ghost Writer</li><li>Glamorous</li><li>How I Met Your Father</li><li>Queer As Folk</li><li>Star Trek VI</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-sarah-jessica-parker-39-s-net-worth><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What Is Sarah Jessica Parker's Net Worth?</span></h2><h3 id=sarah-jessica-parker-played-carrie-bradshaw-on-sex-and-the-city>Sarah Jessica Parker Played Carrie Bradshaw On Sex And The City</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/sarah-jessica-parker-in-satc.jpg><p>It's not surprising that<strong> Sarah Jessica Parker is reportedly worth $200 million</strong>, according to Celebrity Net Worth. While Stylecaster claims her net worth isn't quite so high (they rank it at $150 million), there's no doubt that Parker is by far the wealthiest member of the cast. In the later years of the original Sex and the City, <strong>Sarah Jessica Parker was earning an insane $3.2 million per episode</strong>. According to Stylecaster, she earned $1 million per episode of And Just Like That. As for portraying Carrie Bradshaw in the movies, Sarah Jessica Parker reportedly banked $15 million for the first feature and $20 million for the second.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sarah Jessica Parker has also had a prolific commercial career and has numerous endorsement deals with products. There's no doubt that a humungous chunk of revenue comes from these deals. Then, to cap it all off, Parker has also starred in numerous other series and movies that added to both her star power and her net worth. They include Divorce, Hocus Pocus 1 and 2, Glee, Mars Attacks!, Ed Wood, Footloose, Did You Hear About The Morgans?, Failure To Launch, and The Family Stone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqnrBdlruledOhnGabmanGbq%2FArKtmqpGjuKawjJuwZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
