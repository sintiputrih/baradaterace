The mother-of-one looked fabulous when she rocked a fitted pale pink <strong>C/Meo Collective Clean Slate Jumpsuit</strong> featuring long-sleeves, which she rolled up, straight-leg pants, and an elastic belt that cinched in her tiny waist. Down the entire front of the casual but sexy jumpsuit, was a chunky white zipper, which she kept zipped up all the way. She accessorized her cool outfit with a pair of Y<strong>eezy Boost 350 V2 Sneakers</strong> in Triple White and <strong>Victoria Beckham Flat Top Visor Sunglasses</strong>. We absolutely loved Eva’s outfit and she managed to make her casual ensemble look super chic and sexy.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><strong>Margot</strong><strong> Robbie</strong>, 28, stole the show at the Dreamland premiere during the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tribeca Film Festival</a> in New York City on April 28. The blonde bombshell looked absolutely stunning in a completely sheer black lace <strong>Chanel</strong> jumpsuit which hugged her figure perfectly. The bodice of the one-piece featured buttons down the front, with a low-cut cleavage-baring neckline. Meanwhile, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her tiny waist </a>was cinched in with a black leather belt with a gold clasp, while the legs of the suit flared out into wide-legs. On top of her sexy lace jumpsuit, she donned a fuzzy black cardigan, which she left open, dressing down the look a bit. She topped her look off with a simple pair of satin black pointy-toed pumps. Aside from Margot, another one of our fave celebs who rocked a jumpsuit recently is <strong>Sofia Richie</strong>, 20. Sofia looked flawless when she headed to the ASOS Life is Beautiful party in Los Angeles on April 25 wearing a pale blue <strong>ASOS Design Tie Waist Linen Collar Jumpsuit</strong> which featured a baggy bodice with a v-neckline, which she chose to go braless under, a cinched in elastic waist, and skinny leg pants. She topped her look off with a pair of clear PVC ankle strap sandals and effortless beachy waves, making this red carpet look sexy, but also dressed down and relaxed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Some of our other favorite stars who have also proved that you can dress down the jumpsuit trend include celebs like <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong>, 38, and <strong>Rosie Huntington-Whiteley</strong>, 31. Kim has been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spotted wearing a jumpsuit</a> on multiple occasions recently. On March 6, Kim was in Paris when she chose to wear a completely sheer black cheetah print vintage <strong>Azzedine Alaia</strong> jumpsuit with just two little black pieces of fabric covering her private parts, topping her look off with a long black velvet duster coat and a pair of patent leather black pumps. Just one day before that, she opted for another vintage <strong>Azzedine Alaia</strong> printed jumpsuit, but this time it was a skin-tight tan leopard print one-piece which she wore with a matching patterned coat on top, and platform leopard booties.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/eva-longoria-pink-jumpsuit-mega-embed.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/margot-robbie-sexy-jumpsuits-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Rosie, on the other hand, has opted for more laid-back jumpsuit styles than Kim has. The gorgeous blonde model opted to wear a tan <strong>Ralph Lauren</strong> Judson Suede Jumpsuit back in February while in New York City. The one-piece featured a wrap-front bodice with a collar, while the waist was cinched in by a thin banded belt. The bottom half of the jumpsuit featured a zipper on the front of the skinny leg trousers, which highlighted Rosie’s lean legs, and she accessorized with <strong>Givenchy</strong> D-Frame Acetate and Gold-Tone Sunglasses, a gorgeous chunky <strong>Simon Teakle</strong> 18KT Gold Curb Link Necklace and <strong>Jimmy Choo</strong> Bronze Minny Leather Sandals. Most recently, Rosie donned a jumpsuit to the Patrick Ta Beauty Collection Launch on April 4, in LA. Her baggy pink <strong>Isabel Marant</strong> Tundra Denim Jumpsuit featured short sleeves, and a cinched in elastic waist. Instead of leaving the flared pant legs out, she tucked them into a pair of black <strong>Isabel Marant</strong> Ladra Leather Over-the-Knee Boots.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The jumpsuit trend doesn’t have to be fancy, which both <strong>Kylie Jenner</strong>, 21, and <strong>Hailey Baldwin</strong>, 22, have proved. Kylie stepped out for lunch in LA on April 3, when she threw on a skin-tight, bright red cotton elastic jumpsuit with sneakers. The sleeveless onesie highlighted Kylie’s curvaceous figure and showed off insane cleavage in the low-cut scoop neckline. Kylie paired the bright outfit with a simple pair of white <strong>Adidas</strong> Falcon Sneakers and a small purse, making the trend super relatable to all of us, as it was casual, but chic. Meanwhile, Hailey has been spotted a few times in this look. One of our favorites was her tan corduroy painter’s uniform look that she wore around Paris on March 3, and her slinky spaghetti strap <strong>Zara</strong> Wrinkled Look Jumpsuit that she wore while on vacation with her new fiancee, <strong>Justin Bieber</strong>, 25.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>No matter what type of jumpsuit you wear this spring, these stars have proved that there’s a ton of different ways to style the one-piece outfit, whether it’s with accessories or shoes. The best part about the look is that it can be dressed up or down, making it the perfect transitional trend.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8Keo56ao2LEpq3RoqWgZZqqurG%2F1KKrrGWWlsCptc6nZK2qlaOxbn%2BUb3Bya2Vk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
