I’m not talking about some token, $2,000-a-year ‘spending money’ stipend for every player.</li><li>I have too many psycho superstitions.</li><li>I’m a communist, man. I’m going to break the rules.</li><li>Too many people in charge at ESPN, for my taste, were a little too fearful. It’s a Disney network. There are just certain boundaries that you can’t even tiptoe along.</li><li>I’m LeBron’s ‘No. 1 Critic’ and his ‘Biggest Hater.’ I feel a little like <a href=#>Shailene Woodley</a>‘s character in ‘Divergent.’ The government is going to eliminate me because I don’t fit in.</li><li>Interviewing Michael Jordan is like playing him one on one. If he respects you and especially your media platform and he’s amused by your college try, he’ll let you get off a shot or two. Then he’ll go behind his back, give you a head fake and leave you wondering exactly what he meant by this and that.</li><li>You know what, Tom Brady is unlike any quarterback I have ever followed or covered. He is shattering every mold of how a franchise quarterback should be on and off the field. He’s just different.</li></ul><h2>Skip Bayless | Social Media Presence</h2><p>Skip Bayless is currently active on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, with active followers of <strong>388 thousand</strong> followers.
