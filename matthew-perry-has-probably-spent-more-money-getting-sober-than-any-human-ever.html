He first went to rehab in 1997, and he says he's been back to one facility or another 15 times since then. That doesn't come cheap, and it's been a long, hard road to better health for Perry over and above the dollars he's spent.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-339460 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-485110024.jpg alt width=900 height=606 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-339460 class=wp-caption-text>Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic/Getty Images</p><p>Perry is currently in the midst of a media tour to promote his upcoming memoir, and he discussed his battles with opioid addiction in greater detail in an interview with People:</p><p><strong>"The doctors told my family that I had a two percent chance to live. I was put on a thing called an ECMO machine, which does all the breathing for your heart and your lungs. And that's called a Hail Mary. No one survives that."</strong></p><p>Perry also says that one of his big motivations in sharing these details, both with the press and in his memoir, was to help other people who might be going through similar battles:</p><p><strong>"I wanted to share when I was safe from going into the dark side of everything again…I had to wait until I was pretty safely sober – and away from the active disease of alcoholism and addiction – to write it all down. And the main thing was, I was pretty certain that it would help people."</strong></p><p>Perry's memoir "Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing," is set to hit bookstores on November 1.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnC5wK2roZ2nYr2mvtGyZKGZo2K9s7vBmpmlsV2ovaa602akqKqVYrqwusSyZKCdpKm2r7OMrKabnaJiwamtzWaYp7FdncKurc1mnK%2BdomQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
