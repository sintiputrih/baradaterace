Lost star Matthew Fox says he lost his virginity at a rather young age.
&#34;I was 12,&#34; Fox, now 43, says in the May issue of Playboy.
And just like his hit ABC show (which wraps up next month), his first sexual experience was filled with adventure and intrigue.
His unnamed lover, he says, &#34;was about two years older than me. It wasn't her first time.&#34;
Fox continues: &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It wasn't her first time."</p><p>Fox continues: "I can actually see the event in my mind's eye, like photographs. It was in Dubois, Wyoming, where the population sign probably says, to this day, about 1,000."</p><p>And he wasn't deflowered in a cozy bedroom, either: "It happened literally on the ground by a river while a rodeo was going on in town," he confessed. "It was absolutely terrible and awkward–just two f***ing kids lying down and pulling our pants down."</p><p>The actor, who leads the island survivors as Dr. Jack Shephard, also details his more satisfying erotic experiences as a football player at Columbia University. "My sex escapades at Columbia were in my freshman year," he says. "That's what you're supposed to do. We didn't get any of the benefits of being football heroes. There was plenty of sex but no football-hero sex."</p><p>These days, however, he's remained faithful to wife of 19 years Margherita — despite tabloid reports of his affair with a stripper.</p><p>"The story is not true, and I'm not going to comment on it," he tells Playboy.</p><p>"The subject of fidelity is very personal," Fox adds, and goes on to praise Margharita, mother to his two children.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"She's the love of my life. We have managed to both be intensely independent and maintain that strength in our relationship. I am a man, and I am an appreciator of women," he admits to the men's mag.</p><p>"At the same time, Margherita is the sh*t. I can honestly say we're good together. We've been together for 23 years, so let's leave it at that."</p><p>Playboy's new issue hits stands April 16. The final episode of Lost airs May 23.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalp6OpwG65wK2roZ2nYrOwxIyhprBlmWK5sL%2FTZqSyZaaev6i1zaKrsmWRqXqis8RmaGtlYmV%2BcX2SbWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
