Wittek later claimed that many operations and pain drugs caused his seizure. Wittek seems to exhibit the fear of having his pain medication turned off in a hilarious account of his medical appointment following his seizure.</p><h2>What happened To&nbsp;Jeff Wittek?</h2><p>Jeff Wittek reported on his Jeff FM podcast on April 7 that he experienced a seizure owing to problems from pain medication administered after his surgery.&nbsp;Wittek described his doctor’s appointment when she advised him to stop using all painkillers. Wittek sarcastically accused the doctor of removing his only helpful medicine. He also joked about being a “heroin addict” in the doctor’s office. Sadly, this occurrence was a repeat of last year’s nightmare.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Jeff-Wittek-5.jpg alt="Jeff Wittek" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Wittek exposed the specifics of his eye injury in a documentary YouTube series in 2021. And he revealed that he was a member of the Vlog Squad, which included demonetized YouTuber David Dobrik. The act included a crane-like device digging a lake and swinging people from it over the lake.&nbsp;Jeff Wittek performed the act after many members of the group said it was safe. Wittek stated in the film,</p><p>“I recently did 20 plane jumps. What if I swing from a rope over a one-foot-deep lake?”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Jeff-Wittek-6.jpg alt="Jeff Wittek" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>But the rope’s speed surprised Wittek. He also blamed Dobrik, the excavator driver. Wittek reportedly sued Dobrik over the accident.&nbsp;Then Wittek flew towards the camera from the rope. Doctors warned Wittek that the accident’s injuries, particularly near his eye, might have been devastating or deadly a few millimeters away. Jeff Wittek survived the crash but is currently dealing with long-term ramifications.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihnp6WYsSqwNOeomagkZl6onnBq5iipl2osqrG1KucZp6ipLpurculZK2glWK9orXNZqSenJmYrrW1zqdkmp6kmr9utMisZKiolaeutbXOp6po</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
