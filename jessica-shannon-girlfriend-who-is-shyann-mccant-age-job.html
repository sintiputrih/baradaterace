Since information about her relationship with Shyann McCant is becoming public, Mama June’s reclusive daughter posed for new pictures kissing McCant. Jessica and Shyann may have started dating at some point, but as of Memorial Day 2022, they were still together.</p><p>Jessica posted an image on Instagram with a beaming Shyann as the two took a selfie. Only red and blue hearts were used in the WE tv star’s caption, and Jessica added the words “Memorial Day. Remember and honor” was written across the picture of the women, who were both sporting tank tops and looked ready for summer.</p><p>Jessica and Shyann can be seen walking hand in hand and kissing passionately in the fresh photographs that In Touch has obtained.</p><p>In the pictures, the TV personality can be seen grinning while sporting a pair of white shorts and an orange t-shirt.

Although she dated a man named Phillip for more than a year while she was on Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, her relationship with Shyann is the first one she has made public.</p><p>When their mother was with Geno Doak, the Shannon family felt as though she had almost completely vanished. June had completely changed her life and acquired a new physique. After leaving her former life behind, she encountered Geno, who appeared to be in good spirits.</p><p>Sadly, he was anything but, and their journey together was terribly depressing. It involved the abuse of narcotics. In addition, she sold everything she had ever owned to get a quick fix. This includes giving away the car title belonging to her daughter Jessica.</p><p>Jessica arrived after her youngest child, Alana Thompson, had been taken in by her daughter Pumpkin.

In the summer of 2021, June eventually returned to Georgia, and she vowed to Jessica.</p><p>Later on, she would purchase her a new car, and the two of them would live together. In exchange for the house, Jessica agreed to chauffeur Mama June about.</p><p>When June traveled to Alabama to buy her new friend Jordan, 24, a new car and a place to live, that unfortunately turned out to be a pipe dream. The fact that it was meant to be Jessica’s car infuriated the family. The unfulfilled promises caused Jessica to sob in therapy, and her supporters felt deeply sorry for her.</p><h3><strong>Shyann McCant Age</strong></h3><p>In Aug 2022, Shyann McCant is 19 years old.</p><h3><strong>Shyann McCant Family</strong></h3><p>Shyann McCant was born to her mother Trina Childree McCant.
