It’s such an odd thing that we’ve become OK with in the past ten years of social media.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She added, “I think it bugs people that it's not who they expected. But it's my life and I'm not doing anything to please people or to make it a better headline or story.

"Once again, [it's] making a young woman feel like s--t for no reason. I think I did feel s--t for awhile about admitting that, and then I thought, 'How ridiculous is that?'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She continued, "I'm 24 and I can't choose who I love … There's a reason why I'm not with someone my age—It hasn't worked.

"I've always found this part of what people do really bizarre. I'm an actor because I like acting and I don't mind people watching my stuff, but people have no right to educate me on my private life."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Pugh acknowledged that her career as an actress indeed allots a portion of her life to be exposed to the public, but she said she doesn't believe that should pertain to who she chooses to date.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I know that part of being in the spotlight is that people might invade your privacy and have opinions on it, but it’s bizarre that normal folk are allowed to display such hate and opinions on a part of my life that I'm not putting out there," declared Pugh. "It's a strange side of fame that you're allowed to be torn apart by thousands of people even though you didn't put that piece of you out there. … My point to all this is that isn't it odd that a stranger can totally tear apart someone’s relationship and it’s allowed?"<br></p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">Update 4/9/20:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="body-dropcap css-udyf5a emevuu60">Florence Pugh isn't here for social media trolls attacking her relationship.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Little Women star took to Instagram on Wednesday to defend her relationship with actor Zach Braff, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/movies/florence-pugh-slams-fans-who-criticized-her-and-zach-braffs-age-difference-it-is-not-your-place/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="per " class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">per </a><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/movies/florence-pugh-slams-fans-who-criticized-her-and-zach-braffs-age-difference-it-is-not-your-place/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">People</a>. Their low-key coupling is often the subject of criticism since Pugh is 24 and Braff is 45. The actress explained in an almost four-minute-long clip why she decided to turn off the comments on her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a32055257/florence-pugh-zach-braff-birthday-instagram/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="recent birthday post" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">recent birthday post</a> for her beau.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"On Monday, I posted a photo in honor of Zach's birthday and I wrote a birthday message underneath. Within about eight minutes of the photo being posted, I had about 70 percent of the comments hurling abuse and being horrid—basically bullying someone on my page," Pugh said. "It is the first time in my entire Instagram life that I've had to turn off the comments on my page. I've never been an Instagram page that encourages that. I've never been an Instagram page that likes that toxic vibe."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The actress continued, stating that during a period when the world is battling an ongoing health crisis is not the time to nitpick at who she chooses to date.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It makes me upset that during this time when we need to be together, the world is aching and the world is dying, and a few of you decided to bully for no reason," explained Pugh.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Pugh then declared that as much as she loves her fans, she doesn't need them commenting and sharing their opinions on her personal life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I am 24 years old. I do not need you to tell me who I should and should not love, and I would never in my life tell anyone who they can and cannot love. It is not your place," said the actress. "The abuse that you throw at him is abuse that you are throwing at me, and I don't want those followers. I do not want to have to be protecting my comments every time I post a picture of him. I really hope that I can continue this relationship with a lot of you."</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">Original Story 12/29/19:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="body-dropcap css-udyf5a emevuu60">Actress Florence Pugh, 23, is reportedly dating actor and director Zach Braff, 44.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While the couple remains pretty private about their romance, Braff decided to comment on a recent photo of Pugh posted on Instagram. The actor commented on the pic with an adorable princess emoji, which was apparently enough to rile up some fans of the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a30123513/little-women-clip-laura-dern-saoirse-ronan/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Little Women actress" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Little Women actress</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/a30352989/florence-pugh-zach-braff-age-difference-criticism-response/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="ELLE UK" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">ELLE UK</a>, one Instagram user responded to Braff's emoji by saying, "You’re 44 years old," while another said, "He looks like your grandfather." Brutal.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It seems that not everyone is a fan of the couple's 21-year age gap, but Pugh has zero chill for anyone criticizing her romance.
