She packed a hospital bag with&nbsp;daughter&nbsp;Vivianne, 7, and left the house with her, son Eric, 5, and husband<strong> Eric Decker</strong>.</p><p>One of Jessie’s Instagram followers commented that she should have&nbsp;“one more” child, while another wrote, “You may have another you never know.”</p><p>The Just Jessie author exclusively told Us Weekly in January that <a href=#>she wasn’t sure a fourth baby was&nbsp;“in the cards”</a>&nbsp;for her and the former&nbsp;professional&nbsp;football player, 34.</p><p>“We’re in such a good rhythm right now,” Jessie explained at the time. “I feel like we’re good right now. We’re good at where we are. We’re busy enough. We have so many things going on.”</p><p>Her husband, however, wanted “more.” She added:&nbsp; “He just loves our babies so much. I told him he’s got to just hang on for a minute there. … &nbsp;He doesn’t want to permanently do anything about it, so he is leaving things open. I’m not, but he is.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Jessie-James-Decker-Says-She-Doesnt-Plan-to-Get-Pregnant-Again.jpg><p>In December 2020, Jessie told Eric to “chill” when he told her about <a href=#>his baby fever</a>. “I’m like, ‘You are out of your darn mind,’” the “Flip My Hair” singer told Us at the time. “’Pump the brakes a little bit.’”</p><p>While the couple had different ideas about expanding their family, their parenting styles are similar.</p><p>“We view the world the same way and we parent the same way,” the Just Feed Me author told Us. “We all sit at the dinner together every night and we say our prayers and we eat and talk about our day. We wake up every morning and have our coffee together and spend time together. It works. We have our routine, and it’s so important as parents to have [that].”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGajnaOotqZ5yZqknqtdmbKkt8SrZKKrnql6sbjAp6Wippdirq%2B706Gcq2Wgp7KousCnmrJlnaS%2FpnnKopusZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
