All of her efforts have helped put her net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Julie Powell? As of mid-2017, sources estimate a net worth that is at $5 million, mostly earned through success in writing and film. She also maintains a blog, as well as continuing to write. Her blog became very popular and led her to many other opportunities. As she continues her career, it is expected that her wealth will continue to increase.</p><h3>Julie Powell Net Worth $5 million</h3><p>Julie grew up in Austin, and attended Amherst College where she studied theater and creative writing. After graduating in 1995, she started working for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation.</p><p>In 2002, Powell started her blog called the “Julie/Julia Project”, which she chronicled her attempt to cook all of the recipes in the Julia Child cookbook – “Mastering the Art of French Cooking”.</p><p>Julia had become a very successful television chef, and the book was a collaboration of several people. As Julie continued to blog, it soon gained a large following, and was notice by Little, Brown and Company which gave her a book deal.</p><p>Her net worth started to increase and it eventually led to her own book “Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen” which was published in 2005; there was also a paperback version entitled “Julie and Julia: My Year of Cooking Dangerously”. Child eventually discovered the blog and apparently wasn’t impressed, calling the endeavor a stunt. According to Child’s editor Judith Jones, Powell never truly made an effort to describe the taste or what she learned from cooking. Despite that, she was rewarded with an honorary diploma from Le Cordon Bleu, ironically the same school where <a href=#>Julia Child</a> had studied.</p><p>Julie started a second book, and eventually published “Cleaving: a Story of Marriage, Meat and Obsession” which was published in 2009. The book details the effect of an affair she had after publishing the first book on her marriage, and describes what she learned about the butchering trade. In the same year, a film adaptation of her book was produced, entitled “Julie & Julia”, directed by <a href=#>Nora Ephron</a> and based on Powell’s book as well as <a href=#>Julia Child’s</a> autobiography “My Life in France”. Meryl Streep starred as <a href=#>Julia Child</a>, while <a href=#>Amy Adams</a> portrayed Powell, with other actors including <a href=#>Chris Messina</a> and <a href=#>Stanley Tucci</a>. The film received positive reviews and was also successful at the box office. Thanks to these, Powell’s net worth continued to increase.</p><p>For her personal life, it is known that Julie is married to Eric Powell who she had met in high school, and is an editor for the magazine “Archaeology”. According to an interview, her work with the Julie/Julia project led her to embrace her writing more, as opposed to her cooking.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=5.1266968325792><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Julie Powell</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>April 20, 1973</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Austin, Texas, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Writer, Author</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Amherst College (1995)</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Eric Powell</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Julia Anne Foster</td></tr><tr readability=0.23529411764706><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://imdb.com/name/nm2823045</a></td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Awards</td><td>James Beard Award for Magazine Feature with Recipes, James Beard Award for Magazine Feature Writing without Recipes, Quill Award for Debut author of the year</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>Julie & Julia</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><h3 class=toggle-head>Writer <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=writer><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Julie & Julia</td><td>2009</td><td>book "Julie & Julia"</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=3><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Rocco's Dinner Party</td><td>2011</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr><td>Rachael Ray</td><td>2010</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Secret Ingredients: Creating Julie & Julia</td><td>2009</td><td>Video short</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The 2nd Annual Quill Awards</td><td>2006</td><td>TV Special</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Iron Chef America: The Series</td><td>2006</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself - Judge</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Archive Footage <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><h3>Known for movies</h3><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqOspaGVYr2ww8Slo2amlal6uLvRrZ9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
