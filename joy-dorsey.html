However, due to the economic downturn, Jimmy, his wife, and their two children were forced to move in with Jimmy’s mother-in-law. Jimmy was desperate for work when he received the offer from Gold Rush, which he eagerly accepted.</p><p>Jimmy joined the mining team and traveled to Alaska in the hopes of striking gold, but he did not bring his wife or children with him. Instead, the plan was for Jimmy to settle up there before the family moved there.</p><p>But, sadly, Joy was unable to travel to Alaska because her husband, Jimmy, left the season halfway through due to a disagreement with one of his teammates.Because Jimmy abruptly left the show in the middle, little was known about his wife Joy.</p><p>A look at her Facebook page, however, revealed that the family was happily living in Happy Valley, Oregon, with Jimmy returning to his real estate business. The couple also appeared to have a third child, a daughter named Ella. With the addition of Ella, the Dorseys now have three children, a son and a daughter named Ella.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Television Personality</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Wiki, Net Worth, Height, Girlfriend And Career Of Laurie Kynaston</a></h3>From Shrewsbury, Shropshire, Laurie Kynaston is an English actress, model, television personality, businesswoman, and internet sensation.
