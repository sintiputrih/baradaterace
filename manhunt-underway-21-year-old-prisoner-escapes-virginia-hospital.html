He was under the supervision of two prison security officers but managed to leave the hospital at around <strong>5:42 a.m. on foot. Roulack</strong>, also known as Lil Nas, was last seen casually walking on Franklin Street in the Near West End. The search effort involves the <strong>Virginia Department of Corrections</strong> <strong>(VDOC),</strong> <strong>state police, and Henrico Police</strong>.</p><p>Officials have indicated that Roulack left the hospital without the security officers’ <strong>supervision at around 5:50 a.m. Crime</strong> Insider sources mentioned a break-in at an elderly man’s home on Wythe Avenue near the hospital. Some of the man’s belongings, including car keys, credit cards, wallet, cash, and clothes, were taken, although the car itself was not stolen.</p><p>Law enforcement experts are investigating how Roulack managed to escape from the security officers assigned to him. Miles Turner, a law enforcement consultant, suggested that an inside job or a lapse in following procedures could be responsible for the escape. Roulack was secured with flex cuffs due to the limitations of metal shackles in an <strong>MRI.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Roulack,</strong> who is serving a <strong>13-year</strong> sentence for various charges, was at the hospital for medical treatment related to seizures. He has an extensive criminal history in the Woodbridge area. After his escape, the hospital was placed on lockdown, and authorities began searching for him. Citizens were warned not to approach Roulack due to his criminal background, and anyone with information about his whereabouts was urged to contact the authorities.</p><p>Roulack’s current attire was described as jeans, a gray shirt, and a black hat with “Richmond” written on it. He was last seen wearing a gray t-shirt, black shorts, and carrying a backpack. His medical gown and restraints were recovered near the hospital.</p><p>Authorities provided descriptions of Roulack, stating that he is a Black male, 5 feet 8 inches tall, weighing 177 pounds, with black hair and brown eyes. He has four tattoos, including “Cut Throat” on his right cheek, “RIP ish” on his left arm, “Faith is Seeing with Your Heart When All Your Eyes See is Darkness” on his right arm, and “Marie” on his chest.</p><p>If anyone sees Roulack, they are advised not to approach him but to call 911 immediately.
