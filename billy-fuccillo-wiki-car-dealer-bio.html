He graduated with a degree in marketing in 1978 and began working in auto dealerships, eventually venturing into business and purchasing his first car dealership in 1989. Following that, he gradually worked on making money and purchasing other dealerships, putting a strong emphasis on promotion and marketing. In 1981, he purchased his first wholesale automobile business, and in 1989, he opened his first new store in Adams, just south of Watertown.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Billy_Fuccillo_Career></span>Billy Fuccillo&nbsp;Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He currently manages over 25 dealerships with over 30 franchises, the most of which are in the New York and Florida areas. He oversees over 1,400 staff and is expanding on Grand Island as well. The Fuccillo Automotive Group, a vast group of car dealerships, presently operates under the name Fuccillo Automotive Group and sells new and used vans, cars, trucks, and SUVs. Billy has mastered his marketing skills and is recognized for spending millions of dollars to promote his enterprises. His commercials can be found on planes, buses, newspapers, billboards, and other forms of media such as television and radio. He also enjoys promoting his business, such as giving away a 1,400 square foot mansion in 2010. Billy is also recognized for always following market trends and adapting in response to things like how people are increasingly concerned with gas mileage and technology. The brand also has a catchphrase that was created by Fuccillo and is frequently visible on billboards. The catchphrase is “HUUUU-JA,” and they also utilize the term “it’s huge!” as a trademark. Fuccillo has received two national honors for his Kia branch’s successes, as well as a Best New Dealer award for the largest retail sales volume.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibiography.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/billy-fuccillo-3-300x169.jpg.webp alt="Billy Fuccillo" width=769 height=433 sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Billy_Fuccillo_Personal_Life></span>Billy Fuccillo&nbsp;Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Cindy Fuccillo is best known for being the wife of&nbsp;Billy. They have a son, Billy Fuccillo Jr., who owns 5 dealerships in total, with 3 located in New York and 2 in Florida. Billy took his son to dealerships on purpose so that he could understand the ins and outs of the business. Fuccillo has also been the subject of legal issues and critiques, such as the $1.6 million he paid to settle a lawsuit alleging that he was selling an overpriced and illegal protection package. Billy Fuccillo is said to have died on June 18th, 2021, at the age of 65, in his Florida home after a protracted illness. His wife, Cindy, and son, Billy Jr., the president of the Fuccillo Automotive Group, survive him. Sources believe that he has a net worth of more than $100 million as of mid-2016, owing to the success of his vehicle dealerships. Billy owns many residences in Mexico, New York, Fort Lauderdale, and Jamaica as part of his vast fortune. He also has his own private jet, which he uses to get about to his different business locations. His wealth will almost certainly expand as he maintains his business.</p><p>Here is the full bio of Billy, his birthday, age, career, profession, father, mother, sister, family, education, Wife, high school, University, nationality, Death Date, Place Of Death, birthplace, hometown, height, weight, body type, income, net worth, Children and Other details.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Billy_Fuccillo_Height_Weight_Profile_Net_Worth></span><span style=font-weight:400>Billy Fuccillo, Height, Weight, Profile, Net Worth</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><table><tbody><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Real name</span></td><td>William Bruce Fuccillo Sr.</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Gender&nbsp;</span></td><td>Male</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Age&nbsp;</span></td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Year of birth</span></td><td>1957</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Birthplace&nbsp;</span></td><td>New York,&nbsp; United States</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Nationality&nbsp;</span></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Hometown</span></td><td>Greenport, Long Island</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Profession</span></td><td>Business Man</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Height&nbsp;</span></td><td>6 feet and 3 inches</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Weight&nbsp;</span></td><td>118 Kg</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Date Of Death</span></td><td>June 18th, 2021</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Place of Death</span></td><td>Florida</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Marital status</span></td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td>University</td><td>Syracuse University</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>High School</span></td><td>Greenport High School</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Parents&nbsp;</span></td><td>Vito and Joan (Bollman) Fuccillo</td></tr><tr><td>Wife</td><td>Cynthia (Karaffa) Fuccillo</td></tr><tr><td>Sibling</td><td>sister, Joanie Fuccillo and brother, Gary Fuccillo</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Children</span></td><td>William Bruce Fuccillo, Jr</td></tr><tr><td><span style=font-weight:400>Net worth</span></td><td>$100 Million</td></tr></tbody></table><h3></h3><h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibiography.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/billy-fuccillo-1-300x157.jpg.webp alt="Billy Fuccillo" width=768 height=402 sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Some_Lesser_Known_Facts_About_Billy></span>Some Lesser Known Facts About Billy:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><li>Billy was born to Vito and Joan (Bollman) Fuccillo in 1957 at Greenport, Long Island, New York, in the United States.</li><li>He is survived by his two siblings namely, sister, Joanie Fuccillo and brother, Gary Fuccillo.</li><li>Last year, he sold Cape Coral’s mansion for $2.25 million to Kevin Ruane’s family trust, a Lee County Commissioner and former Sanibel Mayor.</li><li>Veto Fuccillo, his father, was a hairstylist.</li><li>He stands 6′ 3″ tall and weighs 118 kilograms.</li><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Billy_Fuccillo_Social_Media_Accounts></span>Billy Fuccillo&nbsp;Social Media Accounts:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><a href=#>Instgram&nbsp;</a></p><p><a href=#>Twitter</a></p><p>Also Read: <a href=# rel=noopener>Belle Hassan: Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Father, Profession, Net Worth, Family</a></p><p>Subscribe to us to get the latest updates about Billy Fuccillo!</p><h3>Related Posts:</h3><ul><li><a href=# class="crp_link post-39148"><span class=crp_title>Cindy Fuccillo (Billy Fuccillo's Wife): Wiki, Bio,…</span></a></li><li><a href=# class="crp_link post-53716"><span class=crp_title>Billy Gilmour: Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Footballer,…</span></a></li><li><a href=# class="crp_link post-149032"><span class=crp_title>Billy Wayne Smith (Anna Nicole Smith's Ex-Husband):…</span></a></li><li><a href=# class="crp_link post-2851"><span class=crp_title>Billy Angel Wiki| Biography| Height| Age|…</span></a></li><li><a href=# class="crp_link post-118931"><span class=crp_title>Billy Brownless: Wiki, Bio, Age, Career, Family,…</span></a></li><li><a href=# class="crp_link post-31888"><span class=crp_title>Billy Magnussen: Wiki, Bio, Nationality, Career,…</span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2o7XOoKmaqJiue6q6jpugpaSpYrO2r8Kio6WnXay2rLWMnJirZZSarq2x0WaZoqdf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
