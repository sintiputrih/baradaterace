She revealed that she had gotten to know him ‚Äúpretty well‚Äù leading up to the execution and said:</p><p>‚ÄúI got to know him pretty well in his last few days, and I posted it all on social media because he really wanted me to share his story.

She began crying and revealed on a confessional during The Kardashians that she feels the ‚Äúsystem is broken.‚Äù The star added:</p><p>‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt hold it in, and the fact that he was calming me down from crying really broke my heart. This is why I do what I do, because the system is so broken. I think my goal is just sharing the process so that people can see what our system is really like and how inhumane the death penalty really is. I have to fight harder to make sure this doesn‚Äôt happen to someone else.‚Äù</p><p>She fought for him while studying the California Law Office or Judge‚Äôs Chamber Program.
