So those hungry for the super-spy‚Äôs return are entertaining themselves by pitching some intriguing, left-field choices for the role.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=549 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>Forget the Idris Elbas and Henry Cavills ‚Äî as good as both of those actors, and the other more obvious picks for the part, would be, maybe what the franchise needs next is to go for someone a little bit more unexpected. Although it‚Äôs hard to remember now, Daniel Craig was seen as a shocking hire back in the mid-aughts, and now he‚Äôs many people‚Äôs favorite Bond of them all. So sometimes it really pays to take a risk. But do any of these actors have a decent shot of driving the Aston Martin next?
