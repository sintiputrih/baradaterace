Kandi shared multiple photos of her Halloween look on Instagram, including cute snaps of her with husband <strong>Todd Tucker</strong>, who went as Ghost from Power&nbsp;and their three-year-old son, <strong>Ace</strong>, who was dressed as an astronaut.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“Here kitty kitty!”, she captioned a post of her individual costume on Instagram, which included a snap of her look from the front and back. Kandi showed off her fit figure in a velvet, beige bodysuit with a fur hood attached, along with a tail on her backside and lion ears on her head. She rocked white fishnet stockings under her leather thigh high boots.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The mother of two took her lionesque makeup to the next level, having created an animal-like nose and pout to emulate the character — and, it looked so real! Her voluminous dark wig was down with big waves, as seen in one shot where she posed with her hands in the air. The second photo of her backside showed off a portion of her toned thigh and booty.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>(Photo credit: Kandi Burruss/Instagram)&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>In a closeup snap of her makeup, Kandi admitted that she “loved” how it turned out. She revealed that she sought inspiration from a New York City based woman who does cosplay, and even tagged her. Kandi also gushed over her glam squad on Instagram — ‘Makeup by Lah’ and <strong>Derek Jae</strong>, who did her hair.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH5ye49qZqSZnpm2bq7Uq6muq6Niuaq7zWaioqaXYrWiuMuorp6dnmKwsL%2FTrqSeZWJlfnp5z6GmraejZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
