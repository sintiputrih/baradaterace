However, Lynn definitely enjoyed the riches of this world before she died. According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Lynn had accumulated a net worth of $65 million. According to <a href=#>The Guardian</a>, Lynn produced 60 albums and racked up 18 Grammy nominations (and three wins) for her efforts. Her earnings appear to come from a mix of performance fees and songwriting royalties, as Lynn wrote many (not all) of her "most important" hits,&nbsp;according to <a href=#>U Discover Music</a>.</p><p>Before becoming a recording artist, Lynn worked hard labor. She told <a href=#>NPR</a> in 2021 that she used to work as a maid for 36 ranch hands, cooking and cleaning while also caring for her four children. "It wasn't easy, let me tell you," she said. "Life was hard."</p><p>Despite her success, Lynn never stopped working on her craft and continued doing what she loved most. Even though she got her first taste of success in the 1960s, Lynn released music up until the very end. Per&nbsp;<a href=#>GMA</a>, Lynn's last album, "Still Woman Enough," came out in March 2021 and contained collaborations with country music veterans Reba McEntire and Carrie Underwood.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhjbIR3fI6hprBlnaqwqXnWmqpmpJ%2BnsrXAwGajsqaeYsSwvtOhZLCglaN6tLTEZpuinZRk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
