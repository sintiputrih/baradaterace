And yet, a recent comment by <strong>Leonard Ellerbe</strong>, the CEO of Mayweather Promotions, has left fans and pundits scratching their heads. Boxing aficionados know Ellerbe for his straight-shooting remarks. But this time, his choice to reference is none other than the legendary <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Floyd Mayweather</strong></a>, in connection with <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Jermell Charlo’s</strong></a> imminent clash with <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Canelo Alvarez.</strong></a> And it has certainly turned heads.</p><p>No, Mayweather isn’t making another sensational comeback. Instead, Ellerbe has found an odd parallel between Mayweather and Charlo that he believes could be Charlo’s wild card. But what could Floyd Mayweather possibly have to do with Jermell Charlo’s chances against Alvarez?</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Charlo’s weight: A game-changer in the bout against Canelo Alvarez?</h2><p>The boxing arena is buzzing with anticipation for the upcoming face-off between <strong>Jermell Charlo</strong> and <strong>Canelo Alvarez</strong>, set to ignite fireworks on <strong>September 30</strong>. Amidst the torrent of predictions and analyses, <strong>Leonard Ellerbe’s</strong> discerning remarks during a recent interview with <strong>Fighthype.com</strong> bring a fresh perspective that’s worth delving into.</p><p>Undoubtedly, Ellerbe’s authority in the boxing sphere lends weight to his words. Hence, when he dragged <strong>Floyd Mayweather</strong> into the discussion, it was bound to stir intrigue. Ellerbe reminisced about Mayweather’s ascension, particularly when “Money” transitioned to fighting at 147 pounds. He elaborated on how Mayweather’s ability to comfortably walk around at that weight contributed significantly to his strength and endurance in the ring.</p><p>Transitioning to the core of his argument, Ellerbe drew a parallel between Mayweather’s physique and Charlo’s preparation for his face-off against Alvarez. According to Ellerbe, just like Mayweather, Charlo’s fighting weight for the upcoming bout is not a liability but an asset. He confidently stated, “People think that’s a disadvantage for Jermell but I think it’s actually an advantage for him.”</p><p>His remarks turn the spotlight onto a frequently overlooked aspect of boxing—weight management. Bulking up is a common practice aimed at gaining extra power. Ellerbe’s comparison accentuates the importance of natural strength and comfort at one’s fighting weight.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Freddie Roach’s bold prediction: Charlo’s knockout victory over Canelo Sparks controversy</h2><p>With the atmosphere intensifying around the much-awaited bout between Canelo Alvarez and Jermell Charlo on September 30, notable boxing personalities have been tossing in their predictions, adding fuel to the anticipation. <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Among the bold prognostications is one from the eminent boxing trainer</a>, <strong>Freddie Roach</strong>. Known for his illustrious tenure alongside <strong>Manny Pacquiao</strong>, Roach’s opinions carry substantial weight in the boxing community. However, his recent forecast has sparked a maelstrom of reactions.</p><p>Roach, with his seasoned eye, sees a forthcoming knockout victory for Charlo. According to <strong>Boxing Social</strong>, he made a stirring declaration, stating, “This version of Canelo will not be able to handle Charlo.”</p><p>He further extolled Charlo’s “downright vicious” demeanor, asserting that such an attitude demonstrates a fighter who “cannot be intimidated.”</p><p>This unequivocal prediction has split the tide of opinions among boxing aficionados. While some rally behind Roach’s experienced-backed foresight, others vehemently oppose it, underlining the sheer unpredictability inherent in boxing predictions.</p><p>Roach’s stark assessment not only amplifies the buzz surrounding the fight but lays down an intriguing narrative contrast as fans ardently debate the possible outcomes.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-boxing-news-real-reason-jermell-and-jermall-charlos-wives-got-into-physical-altercation-at-a-public-parking-lot?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20210204200725/GettyImages-1157887352-474x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">Real Reason Jermell and Jermall Charlo’s Wives Got Into Physical Altercation at a Public Parking Lot?</p></a><p>As the fighters lace up for the colossal showdown, Roach’s words reverberate through the charged discussions.
