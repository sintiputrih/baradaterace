However, having great skincare products on deck can absolutely help with evening out complexion, boosting hydration, and smoothing out texture — all of which are essential for achieving clear, radiant skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So here's my honest review of all three products in the line. Hopefully it will help you decide if Humanrace is the celebrity skincare line you've been waiting for.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-rice-powder-cleanser></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Rice Powder Cleanser</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$32; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>humanrace.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you've ever used one of Tatcha's Rice Polish cleansers before, then you already know the drill. If not, this cleanser comes in, you guessed it, powder form, then turns into a creamy foam once you add a little water.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As the first step in the Humanrace routine, this product promises to get rid of oil, makeup, and other impurities with a little light exfoliation, all without stripping moisture.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On my combination skin, it kept its promises — even in areas that tend to be more dry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You know that tight, dry feeling you sometimes get after washing your face? That was nowhere to be found once I was done. And my skin felt noticeably smoother immediately after use. I also like that it offers very, very gentle physical exfoliation with the rice powder, and also includes fruit AHAs for chemical exfoliation as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As far as packaging goes, it comes with a twist-off top to help avoid any spills and includes the name of the product in braille, which I don't think I've ever seen a skincare brand do before. That really stood out for me, because beauty should be accessible for all.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">My only issue with the packaging (and I totally get why they made it this way) is the fact that the only way to get the powder out is through a tiny hole at the top. So I can imagine it's going to be kinda tough to get that final scoop out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's probably not a huge deal for most people, but I'm the type of person who will cut through a bottle of lotion to scrape out the last little bits. I'm Jamaican, I can't help it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In any case, if you decide to buy the Rice Powder Cleanser, just don't forget that it's fully recyclable and refillable (along with the other two products in the line). So for the love of God, don't throw it in the garbage!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Pharrell Williams Wants a World in Which Women Aren't Held Back</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-lotus-enzyme-exfoliator></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Lotus Enzyme Exfoliator</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$46; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>humanrace.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Alright, let's get into step two: the Lotus Enzyme Exfoliator.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The first thing you should know is that this product is meant to be used two to three times a week. But if you're not familiar with exfoliation or have sensitive skin, I would say start off by using it once a week and seeing how it goes, although it is quite gentle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This product offers a pull-off top, which admittedly confused me at first. I was there twisting it around and around until kingdom come until I realized I was doing it wrong (oops). But anyways, once I finally got to it, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the exfoliator comes with a pump top, which is perfect for getting just the right amount without exposing the actual cleanser to any potential bacteria or God knows what else.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I applied two pumps of the creamy formula to my face and massaged it in for a few minutes with my hands, then rinsed it off. Like the Rice Powder Cleanser, it offers both chemical and very gentle physical exfoliation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's made with 8% glycolic acid, which works to even out skin tone and smooth out texture. And while these types of products can leave the skin dry after use, homegirl didn't do me like that. Plus, I did notice a slight reduction in pigment with a few dark spots on my forehead after about a week of use.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-humidifying-cream></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Humidifying Cream</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To shop: </strong>$48; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>humanrace.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here we are, at the final step: the Humidifying Cream, which brings us back to twist-off tops, just FYI.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I have to be completely honest: this cream is my absolute favorite product in the line. Like, if you're going to go with just one thing from Humanrace, I'd say go for the cream. She is truly that girl.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even with the richest of moisturizers, I've always found that — especially in the fall/winter time — I would still wake up with dry patches. But the Humidifying Cream, which includes both snow mushroom extract and squalane (so duh, obviously it's deeply hydrating), completely, completely changed the game for me. Bonus: she's quite thicc, so a little goes a long way with this one.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-final-verdict></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Final Verdict:</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I would say this line is worth it if you're looking for a simple skincare system that generally offers everything you need for clear, hydrated skin. Plus, you can't go wrong with clean, vegan formulas inside fully recyclable and refillable packaging. However, I do hope they'll eventually add an eye cream to the mix. That's the one thing missing, in my opinion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For my own personal use, I think I'll probably be using the line conjunction with a few other serums and face oils I have on deck moving forward — but I'm also extra. So feel free to not do that if you don't have the time or simply don't want to. Humanrace is a solid skincare line all on its own.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From non-toxic makeup and skincare to sustainability practices, Clean Slate is an exploration of all things in the green beauty space.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZL2iwcuaqmabmKS2pLGMm5%2BaZZyevra1w2acsZ6fobaiutNmoa6lkqQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
