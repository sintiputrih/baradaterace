The FDA calls it “pasteurized processed <b>American cheese</b> product.” In order for a food product to be a true “<b>cheese</b>,” it has to be more than half <b>cheese</b>, which is technically pressed curds of milk.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-difference-between-american-cheese-and-normal-cheese></span>What is the difference between American cheese and normal cheese?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>American cheese</b> isn’t even considered to be real <b>cheese</b>. It’s called a “pasteurized <b>cheese</b> product.” While it was originally a blend <b>of different cheeses</b> like Colby and <b>cheddar</b>, now the <b>American cheese</b> we see <b>in the</b> likes <b>of</b> Kraft Singles is not made with at least 51 percent <b>of</b> real <b>cheese</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-cheddar-cheese-american-cheese></span>Is Cheddar cheese American cheese?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Modern <b>American cheese</b> is a type of processed <b>cheese</b> made from <b>cheddar</b>, Colby, or similar <b>cheeses</b>. It is mild with a creamy and salty flavor, has a medium-firm consistency, and has a low melting point.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-white-cheddar-the-same-as-white-american></span>Is White Cheddar the same as white American?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>3. <b>White Cheddar Cheese</b>. While <b>white cheddar cheese</b> isn’t very mild on the taste scale, it can still melt to a gooey consistency. If it is to be used in place of <b>white American</b>, it is suggested to use a mild version of the <b>cheese</b> to mimic the original taste best.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=whats-the-closest-to-american-cheese></span>What’s the closest to American cheese?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Using a mild <b>cheese</b> like Colby will get you <b>closest</b> to the <b>American cheese</b> you remember from childhood, but feel free to play around with something sharper if you wish. Cheddar makes an assertive substitution, but stay close to the semisoft family of <b>cheeses</b>; the harder, crumblier stuff won’t work.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-i-use-mozzarella-instead-of-cheddar></span>Can I use mozzarella instead of cheddar?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Can I Use Cheddar Cheese</b> as a Substitute for <b>Mozzarella</b>? <b>Cheddar can</b> be substituted for <b>mozzarella</b> and will still create an edible result. Depending on how big a part <b>cheese</b> plays in the recipe, it may end up tasting very different from what you expect, in terms of flavor and texture.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-difference-between-white-cheddar-and-yellow-cheddar></span>What is the difference between white cheddar and yellow cheddar?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>There is no <b>difference</b> in taste when comparing <b>white</b> and <b>yellow cheddar</b> of the same age* – the only <b>difference</b> is the annatto food coloring. The only other <b>cheese</b> we use annatto is Colby – another traditionally <b>yellow cheese</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-a-healthy-substitute-for-cheddar-cheese></span>What is a healthy substitute for cheddar cheese?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The most common natural <b>cheese substitute</b> is a product called nutritional yeast, a favorite in the vegan community thanks to its nutty, cheesy flavor.
