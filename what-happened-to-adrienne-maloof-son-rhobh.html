During the show’s initial era, <a href=#>Adrienne Maloof</a> leads the charge with Kyle and other Season 1 wives, <a href=#>Taylor Armstrong</a>, Camille Grammer, Kim Richards, and <a href=#>Lisa Vanderpump</a>.</p><p>Adrienne introduced fans to her family, including her now ex-husband and their children. Since she departed from the show, she has continued to make headlines with updates on her personal life.</p><p>In June 2024, Adrienne opened up about a horrific event that included one of her sons. Here’s what the Housewives alumna said and more details on her family.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What happened to Adrienne Maloof’s son?</h2><p>On Tuesday, June 4, 2024, Adrienne appeared on former Flipping Out star <a href=#>Jeff Lewis</a>’s Sirius XM radio show. During their chat, she discussed almost losing one of her children to a kidnapping at her local Neiman Marcus. She shared that, in 2005, a woman attempted to take her son from her nanny’s arms, causing Adrienne to fear the worst.</p><p>"My nanny and I were there, and security was over further away, and this lady came up, and my son was crying, and she actually took him out of my nanny's hands and started going towards the elevator," she recalled on the radio show.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@adriennemaloof</a></figure><p>Adrienne told Jeff and fellow guest <a href=#>Cynthia Bailey</a> that she couldn’t believe the “terrible” event happened at a luxury store like Neiman Marcus. As Jeff jokingly said elsewhere, such behavior is more reserved for a “Macy’s” or less upscale department store. While reflecting on the incident, Adrienne said she felt the woman intentionally chose the store to find a child with wealthy parents.</p><p>“That's at Neiman Marcus, but I guess it makes sense if you're looking for kids that come from wealth,” she stated.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Adrienne said she was grateful to have security around during her son’s attempted kidnapping.</h2><p>Adrienne’s story could’ve ended tragically for her and her family. Fortunately, she had her security guard a few feet away from the scene. Though the security was unable to stop the woman from snatching her baby from the nanny, Adrienne said he stepped in as soon as he saw what was going on.</p><p>“I was glad he saw it," she admitted. "He wanted to be away from us. We were just sitting there, and he was giving] us our freedom, but no. He was on top of it. I actually thought, 'Wow, thank god,' because what if he wasn't there."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Adrienne Maloof (@adriennemaloof)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Does Adrienne Maloof have any more kids?</h2><p>Adrienne didn’t share which of her children was almost kidnapped in Neiman Marcus. However, since she said in 2024 that it happened “19 years ago,” we’re going to assume she was talking about her and Paul’s eldest son, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gavin</a>, born in 2003.</p><p>After Gavin was born, Adrienne and Paul went on to have their twin sons, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collin</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christian</a>. The pair ultimately divorced in 2013 but continued co-parenting as their children aged.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@adriennemaloof</a></figure><p>In June 2024, the exes reunited to celebrate Christian and Colin’s high school graduation.
