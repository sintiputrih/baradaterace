"I don't do it to make an enormous living or to be a celebrity. I do it because I love acting." Her CV, packed with varied, critically-acclaimed roles which forgo the temptation to get by on her looks, confirms that statement.</p><h2>Her career</h2><p id=e4rBP6BDDT21 data-wc=42>In 2009, big screen drama propelled her from low-budget flicks onto the Hollywood radar when she was nominated for a best actress Oscar for her performance as Ray, a tough, blue-collar mother who smuggles illegal immigrants over the Canadian border.&nbsp;</p><p id=eZ_eiiIsSit data-wc=76>Melissa was born in New York on September 14, 1960, the daughter of teacher Peggy, and fisherman father Arnold Leo. As most of her early life was lived out of the spotlight little is known about it - something which no doubt her Oscar win will change.
