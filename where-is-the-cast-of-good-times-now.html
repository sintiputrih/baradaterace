He was a 27-year-old when he was tasked with the role and it catapulted him into the stratosphere. However, once the show ended, he struggled to keep the TV momentum going. Fortunately, Walker was a stand-up comic before his role on TV and that’s the vocation he returned to after it ended. Walker tours the country doing stand-up an average of 25-30 weeks a year, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>.</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Esther Rolle (Florida Evans</strong>)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/gettyimages-3209620-594x594-1.jpg><p data-characters=505 data-current-count=805 data-injectable=true>The Evans family matriarch, played by Esther Rolle, was quite the TV powerhouse in the 1970s.

He left the show before it ended, but his career barely stumbled. Amos left the show in 1976, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Essence</a>, because he was fired.</p><p>“I left because I was told that my services were no longer needed because I had become a ‘disruptive element. ‘ In other words, I didn’t have the diplomacy that I think I’ve cultivated over the last 10 or 15 years.”</p><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>He played the older Kunta Kinte in the 1977 miniseries Roots, which earned him an Emmy nomination.
