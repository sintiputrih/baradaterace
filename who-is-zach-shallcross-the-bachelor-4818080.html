Zach chose to pursue Rachel when he accepted her rose during week three. The two formed a deep connection, but <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>things fell apart</a> for them during the fantasy suite, when Zach was one of just three men left. When the cameras were off, Zach and Rachel didn’t connect like he’d hoped.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“We’re having the important conversation about religion and politics and all that stuff and Rachel brought up her fear that maybe I’m not ready for a commitment of marriage at this early of an age,” Zach explained the next morning. “I’m like, don’t worry about that, I’m here for you. But she got really adamant. I’m like…are you making me second guess? It was a surprise. It was like we were two strangers.” Zach accused Rachel of “putting on a front” with her accusations and said that they “came out of nowhere” for him.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Zach said he felt like Rachel was being “inauthentic” with him in the fantasy suite and admitted that he felt “blindsided” by her questioning him.

Zach and Rachel both apologized to each other, and she explained that she was just trying to get clarity from him in the fantasy suite. “I wanted to see if we could get there,” she revealed. ‘Ultimately, I couldn’t, but I never wanted you to feel like I was going to put you through something like that if I wasn’t trying to see if we could come out on the other side.”</p><h2>What Does Zach Do?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Before appeared on The Bachelorette, Zach worked as a technology sales executive at Oracle in Texas. “My role consists of strategically helping businesses in Houston enhance, extend and leverage their current software, platform, and infrastructure while educating them on what Oracle’s portfolio has to offer,” his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LinkedIn</a> says.
