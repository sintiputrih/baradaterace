From Playboy to Forbes, the 22-year-old beauty entrepreneur has a rich history of making herself known on newsstands.</p><p>But Jenner’s entrepreneurial success didn’t happen overnight. She’s most famously known as a beauty-loving Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, but the Lip Kit creator became a businesswoman when she launched <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Cosmetics</a> in November 2015. She later expanded her brand to unveil <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Skin</a> in May 2019.</p><p>A few months after the debut of her skincare brand, she took the next step to grow her business by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">selling a 51 percent stake</a> in her company to beauty giant Coty for a whopping $600 million. “This partnership will allow me and my team to stay focused on the creation and development of each product while building the brand into an international beauty powerhouse,” she said in a statement.</p><p>So when the E! star landed the cover of Forbes in September 2019, it was obviously a major accomplishment. It’s arguably the youngest self-made billionaire’s most iconic cover of all time and naturally, the L.A. native agrees.</p><p>In September 2019, she touched on that defining moment in her career. “I feel like the cover of Forbes was a huge moment when I exceeded expectations,” the reality star told then-boyfriend <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Travis Scott</strong></a> in an interview for Playboy. “That was a huge moment for me that was great recognition for everything I’ve done.”</p><p>And that brings us to another one of the star’s most talked-about covers: her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sexy Playboy debut</a> for the magazine’s fall 2019 Pleasure Issue. Scott conducted the interview and the two posed for sultry pics together in the photo spread.</p><p>The aforementioned covers are recent, but Jenner’s been appearing on covers for close to ten years now. She posed alongside her sister <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kendall</strong></a> for their first cover in March 2012 for Teen Vogue. And she crushed it on the cover of Seventeen’s prom issue one year later when she was just 16 years old!</p><p>Keep scrolling to see these iconic magazine covers and more of Jenner’s most buzzed-about photo shoots of all time!</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Listen on Spotify to Get Tressed With Us to get the details of every hair love affair in Hollywood, from the hits and misses on the red carpet to your favorite celebrities’ street style ‘dos (and don’ts!)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvKsqOinV2fsq%2B6xKuqZpqVqMFuucCgmLOhnpp6pLvVnqmsZaSdv7DBxqFkraCVYsamrdGsZKmhk6h8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
