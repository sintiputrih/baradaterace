Casual wear is what we’ve come to embrace these days, and that uniform certainly doesn’t have to include overly trendy or high-end pieces.</p><p>Classic garments will never fail Us&nbsp;in the comfort department. Of course, Amazon has tons of basics at affordable prices that are vetted by some of the most passionate reviewers on the internet. This <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">standard zip-up hoodie</a> is our latest find — and judging by the testimonials, it’s worthy of a spot in our closets!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-11-at-9.56.25-AM.png><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class=a-size-large><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Doublju Lightweight Thin Zip-Up Hoodie</a> with free shipping for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">$29</a>, available at Amazon! </span></strong><strong><span class=word><span class=changedDisabled>Get it as soon as May 18, 2020. <span id=productTitle class=a-size-large>Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, May 11, but are subject to change.</span></span></span></strong></p><p>When it comes to simple items like this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">hoodie from Doublju</a>, the small details are what sets it apart from the rest of the pack. This sweatshirt is made from a light, thin cotton-blend material that shoppers say feels like a “really good quality” fabric — especially for the price. This hoodie won’t set you back more than $30, and thanks to the free shipping provided, you won’t see any surprise additional charges at checkout!</p><p>The design of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">the hoodie</a> is as traditional as it gets. It zips up all the way to the top and has pockets on each side of the closure. A thick drawstring is hidden in the hood so that you can tighten it to your liking, or wear it out loose if you prefer. Its ribbed cuffs and hem stay true to the low-key, collegiate feel of the hoodie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-11-at-9.57.03-AM.png><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class=a-size-large><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Doublju Lightweight Thin Zip-Up Hoodie</a> with free shipping for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">$29</a>, available at Amazon! </span></strong><strong><span class=word><span class=changedDisabled>Get it as soon as May 18, 2020. <span id=productTitle class=a-size-large>Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, May 11, but are subject to change.</span></span></span></strong></p><p>Best of all, there are plenty of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">different shades</a> and color combinations to choose from. There are solid picks that range from turquoise to hot pink, or color-blocked options that combine three different hues into one. Some of the options available allow you to pick up <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">this hoodie</a> with a faux-fur lined hood, which is perfect for the chillier season. Shoppers say that if you like your hoodies to be fitted, then ordering your usual size is the way to go. If the oversized vibe that’s dominating Instagram right now is more your style, going up a size or two is completely welcome as well.
