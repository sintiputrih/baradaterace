Some fans speculated that the cover was an attempted shot at Kardashian's ex-husband, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kanye West</a>, amid their feud. However, it appears that Lilah is much more to Drake than just a Kim K look-alike. Earlier today, J Hus dropped a new track titled, "Who Told You," featuring Drake. Drake also seems to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">confess his feelings for Lilah</a> in the song, singing, "So Lilah Pi, don't make my eye cry."

Drake's upcoming summer 2023 tour with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>21 Savage</a> also begins later this month.

Earlier this week, Drake <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">encouraged Kick to give his friend a streaming deal</a> during a livestream. “Yo, listen! I don’t know who owns Kick, but I’m just saying… You know, you guys, I know the chat wants to see Yachty go live. I’ve been telling him, I feel like he could take over Kick," he told the platform. "There’s a little business idea for you guys, whoever’s responsible for writing the checks. You see the chat’s going crazy for my brother.”</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Caroline Fisher is a News Writer at HotNewHipHop from Chicago, Illinois.
