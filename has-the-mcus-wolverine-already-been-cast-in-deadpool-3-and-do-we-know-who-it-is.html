Despite the name in the title, the trailer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">stopped short of giving away too much</a> of Hugh Jackman‚Äôs eagerly anticipated return as Logan, with only the teaser‚Äôs final shots depicting him in action. And even then you can only make him out if you slow down the playback speed.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=402 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=true>To be accurate, a man who strongly resembles Jackman‚Äôs Wolverine also appears earlier in the trailer ‚Äî Deadpool is depicted approaching a poker table in some kind of discreet club at which a man in a snappy white suit with pointy black hair is sitting. It‚Äôs an unfamiliar environment and fashion sense for the Adamantium X-Man but that‚Äôs gotta be him, right? Well, not necessarily.</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=323 data-injectable=false>The thinking goes that this might actually be our first peak at the MCU‚Äôs Wolverine ‚Äî as in the Wolverine of Earth-616 ‚Äì and not the Jackman variant who‚Äôll presumably hail from the Fox-verse. And fans are convinced they know who‚Äôs portraying Logan-616. Could it really be‚Ä¶ <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daniel Radcliffe</a></strong>?</p><h2 id=h-why-do-people-think-daniel-radcliffe-is-the-mcu-s-wolverine data-injectable=false>Why do people think Daniel Radcliffe is the MCU‚Äôs Wolverine?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/DW-Trailer-5-1-1.png><p data-characters=475 data-current-count=475 data-injectable=true>First of all, let‚Äôs be clear: that‚Äôs not necessarily Wolverine in the above image, it‚Äôs Patch. In the comics, Wolverine dons a disguise as a criminal known as Patch when infiltrating the hive of scum and villainy that is Madripoor, in order to investigate supervillains at work on the island. Given that Madripoor was just introduced into the MCU in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, fans are confident that means this particular Wolverine comes from 616.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>My thoughts: this is Patch(of course) but not what you think. Remember in She-Hulk there was an article talking about a man with claws? And how Phase 4 introduced Madripoor? This is the original MCU‚Äôs Logan. Not the one from Fox. And he‚Äôll be played by someone else, not Jackman. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/jLzTYrGtbE</a></p>‚Äî It Was All a Dream, I Used to Read Wizard Magazine (@UpToTASK) <a href=#>February 12, 2024</a></figure><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=484 data-injectable=true>On closer inspection, folks also believe those white suited arms are not quite as bulky as Jackman‚Äôs own and are closer to the physique of long-term Wolverine favorite Radcliffe.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>1 million percent, look at the arms</p><p>I'm just psyched we get Patch and Tiger Stripe costumes in this</p>‚Äî Ryu_Akai91üê≤ (@KentagonJR) <a href=#>February 12, 2024</a></figure><p data-characters=465 data-current-count=765 data-injectable=true>But, hold up, it‚Äôs not just empty fan speculation fueling the Radcliffe rumors. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Daniel Richtman</a> has claimed that the former Boy Who Lived has joined Deadpool 3 behind the scenes in a ‚Äúsecret role.‚Äù It would be entirely in keeping with this franchise if it brought in Radcliffe for a gag scene as Wolverine, in response to the many times over the years when the actor has had to tell interviewers <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‚ÄúI‚Äôm not Wolverine, OK?!‚Äù</a></p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=false>All in all, fans may be jumping the gun slightly in attempting to positively identify Patch Wolverine from just the back of his head and the size of his biceps. And yet it‚Äôs not entirely out of the question that when the MCU‚Äôs incarnation of Logan does show ‚Äî in DP3, coming this July 25, or otherwise ‚Äî we‚Äôll all be shouting ‚ÄúHoly cricket, you‚Äôre Harry Potter!‚Äù</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon5qrXam1pnnMnKysZaekubex0aKlnmWRob%2BmrcOyZJudlaN6pK3SrWSipl2ZsqKwz6impWVjYq6vsIydpmavlWK4r7vWZq6hp12ewW610mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
