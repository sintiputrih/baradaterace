He took to Twitter again later that day with an even more pointed statement: “When you ASSUME to know that which you know nothing of you make an ASS out of U and ME."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

STAR magazine – you don’t get to stand behind ‘freedom of the press’ when you are writing fiction.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>And a source close to Demi tells <strong>HollywoodLife.com </strong>that she and her daughters are “livid” with him for not immediately shooting down these new rumors to his nearly-8 million followers.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“The last time Ashton was accused of cheating, he took action immediately saying that he was going to sue,” the source recalls. “This time around, he hasn’t said anything, which is strange. Demi isn’t sure what to do; she’s waiting for Ashton to make the next move. Her daughters are also really upset and feel betrayed.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>What do you think, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong> — are Ashton & Demi working things out?</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>Get The Latest Ashton and Two And A Half Men!</strong></p><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Spoiler Alert!
