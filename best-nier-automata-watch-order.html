Viewers of the anime can still enjoy the anime for its story, while game fans can also enjoy the continuation of the story they already knew. The anime is currently rated 4.8 stars on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Crunchyroll</a>, the streaming service that picked up the rights to stream in the U.S.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=953 data-current-count=1253 data-injectable=true>While the anime can be enjoyed by itself, the complete story goes even further than the NieR games. The prequel to the story takes place in the Drakengard, Drakengard 2 and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Drakengard 3</a>. These three games are set in Medieval Europe’s Midgard. While humans exist, so do elves, dragons, and magical beings. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NieR</a> is a game that is set in an alternate reality, stemming from one of the Drakengard games’ alternate endings, where magical beings from Drakengard created a portal to present-day Earth which nearly decimated the entire population by introducing a plague. NieR: Automata is set in the same universe as NieR, but takes place thousands of years in the future. Humans built a colony on the moon to survive while sending androids down to Earth to fight against the alien machines. There is also a spin-off called NieR Reincarnation. Released on Android and iOS platforms, the mobile game is set in the same universe, but is its own unique story.</p><p data-characters=128 data-current-count=128 data-injectable=false>With such an extensive background, how far you want to delve into the world of magic, monsters, aliens, and robots is up to you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6bnKysXaO2pr6Mmqytp52WwaJ51pqrnKBdpL%2BlsdFo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
