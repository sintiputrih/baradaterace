He scored in the Super 14 against the Brumbies Ball at 100m.</p><p>After only a handful of games for the Sharks, Francois Steyn impressed the South African coach Jake White and he earned a call-up at only 19 years of age to the Springboks squad to tour Ireland and England. He made a try-scoring debut against the Irish at Lansdowne Road on the wing and after only nine Test caps he had already played at fullback, fly-half, center, and wing.</p><p>Francois Steyn, who scored the decisive drop goal in the 2007 Tri-Nations opener against Australia, was named to the World Cup squad later that year. Although he started on the bench in the tournament, he played as a substitute for Jean de Villiers, who was injured in the first match against Samoa.</p><p>Later in the tournament, when the Springboks faced Tonga in the physical group stage, he and opposing winger Joseph Vaka were embroiled in controversy.

He was called up for the match against Australia on 13 August and played 50 minutes before being replaced by Gio Apron. After the match, however, it was announced that Steyn had suffered a hamstring injury and would miss the test against the All Blacks on 20 August.</p><p>He recovered well in time for the World Cup but suffered a shoulder injury in the final group game against Samoa, which kept him out of the rest of the tournament. Steyn returned to Racing Metro for the 2011/12 season and played a key role in the season. However, in April 2012, Stein announced that he would leave the Paris side at the end of the campaign and return to South Africa.</p><p>In July, he announced his retirement from professional rugby at the age of 36 and renounced taking part in the Rugby Championship and the World Cup in France.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>François Steyn’s Marital Status</h2><p>Francois Steyn is married and got married to Linca Meyer in Durban in June 2012.
