The show has been enjoying rave reviews, is currently in its second season, and will soon give way to a Flash spin-off starring&nbsp;Glee‘s Grant Gustin.</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>Gustin made such a great impression when he guest-starred on&nbsp;Arrow&nbsp;last year that a pilot for&nbsp;<strong>The Flash</strong>&nbsp;was immediately greenlit and is quickly gaining momentum. Today, fans were treated to quite the surprise when John Wesley Shipp, who played Barry Allen in the 1990s&nbsp;Flash&nbsp;series on CBS, was cast in the new show (though his role remains a mystery).</p><p data-characters=725 data-current-count=1082 data-injectable=true>Speculation says that Shipp may be playing Jay Garrick, who comic book readers will remember as the original Golden Age Flash. DC Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns has been frustratingly coy about the casting on Twitter, too, which has only fuelled the Garrick speculation. If it&nbsp;does&nbsp;turn out to be true, that would not only be a fun nod to fans of the original series, but would add an interesting layer to the new show’s mythology. In the universe in which&nbsp;Arrow&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Flash&nbsp;exist, superheroes seem to be a new thing; and The Flash has been touted as the first superpowered individual. So, the idea that someone like Jay Garrick existed in that world brings some interesting questions to the forefront.&nbsp;<i><br></i></p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>Of course, the Jay Garrick role could just be wishful thinking, and Shipp may in fact have been cast as Barry Allen’s father, who has been falsely imprisoned for the murder of Barry’s mother. His father will likely play a large part in the show, and THR reports that Shipp’s role will be a recurring one if the pilot gets picked up for a series.</p><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true>With&nbsp;<strong>The Flash&nbsp;</strong>gearing up for production for its Fall 2014 debut, we can expect to hear more exciting news about the show in the near future.</p><p data-characters=148 data-current-count=148 data-injectable=false>Tell us, are you excited about Shipp’s casting?
