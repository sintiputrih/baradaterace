And because I was hesitant to go back to work and my daughter was starting school and it was an inconvenient time, I said, 'I'll do it if I'm compensated in the right way.' And Chadwick ended up donating some of his salary to get me to the number that I had asked for. He said that that was what I deserved to be paid."</p><p>Sienna explained that she thought it was "unfathomable to imagine another man in that town behaving that graciously or respectfully." She added, "There was no showiness, it was, 'Of course I'll get you to that number because that's what you should be paid.'"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Chadwick Boseman's net worth?
