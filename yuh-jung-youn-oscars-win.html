Tonight, the 73-year-old actress scored a golden statue for Best Supporting Actress for her role in Minari, and made history as the first Korean winner in the category. Right before she claimed her award, however, presenter Brad Pitt—who was an executive producer on the film—mispronounced her name while announcing the nominees.
&#34;Mr. Brad Pitt, finally.

Very nice to finally meet you," she began her speech. "Where were you when we were filming in Tulsa?"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Afterward, she directly addressed Mr. Brad Pitt's blunder with another joke. "As you know, I'm from Korea and actually my name is Yuh-Jung Youn," she said. "Most European people call me Yuh-Young and some of them call me Yoo-Jung. But, tonight, you are all forgiven."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Some people on Twitter took note of her call out.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The actress went on to thank the Academy and her fellow Minari nominees before cracking a few more jokes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I don't believe in competition. Like how can I win over Glenn Close? I've been watching her so many performances," she went on. "So, all the nominees, five nominees, we are the winner of different movies, we played a different role, so we cannot compete each other tonight ... have just a little bit luck, I think. Maybe I'm luckier than you. Also, maybe it's American hospitality for the Korean actor? I'm not sure."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lastly, she gave a nod to her family. "I like to thank my two boys who made me go out and work," she said. "This is the result because mommy worked so hard."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Watch the hilarious speech in its entirety below.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Minari, which was written and directed by Lee Isaac Chung, follows the Korean-American Yi family as they attempt to stamp out a better life in Arkansas under Ronald Reagan's presidency. The film also stars Steven Yeun, Yeri Han, and Alan S.
