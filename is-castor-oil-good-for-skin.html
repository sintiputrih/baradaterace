The oil also contains triglycerides, which can help skin to maintain moisture. Plus it acts as a humectant, meaning it draws water from the air and traps it in your skin, thereby preventing moisture from evaporating. This is especially beneficial in winter when your skin is facing the see-saw of biting cold temperatures outside and central heating indoors.</p><p>While studies on castor oil are currently thin on the ground, one shows that the ricinoleic acid in castor oil may be <a href=#>anti-microbial</a>. "For this reason, castor oil is an effective ingredient to help fight and prevent blemishes and impurities in the skin; even severe cases of <a href=#>acne</a>," explains <a data-offer-url=https://www.susannekaufmann.com/en class=external-link data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.susannekaufmann.com/en"}' href=# rel=noopener>Susanne Kaufmann</a>, founder of her eponymous natural skincare line.</p><p>Another study indicates that castor oil has <a href=#>anti-inflammatory</a> properties. Those with skin complaints such as <a href=#>dermatitis</a>, <a href=#>eczema</a>, <a href=#>rosacea</a>, <a href=#>psoriasis</a>, and <a href=#>keratosis pilaris</a> could also benefit from castor oil as its double-whammy approach soothes itching and fights bacteria.</p><p>“As well as being anti-inflammatory, castor oil is also a diuretic, so it really helps to decongest puffiness,” says Chelsee. “I find it's especially good for massaging into the skin when you're suffering from ‘booze face’ [aka the side effects of over-indulging in too much pinot grigio].” Finally, castor oil is high in antioxidants to help ward off damage from pollution and UV rays.</p><a data-testid=contentPromoEmbedWrapper href=# class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ BaseLink-eNWuiM ContentPromoEmbedWrapper-wTiLP iUEiRd fwrdgh cuqOKN gvjunS"><span class="SpanWrapper-umhxW jvZaPI responsive-asset ContentPromoEmbedResponsiveAsset-zzLFw hbwssY"></span><p>These are the best clarifying face masks to give skin a good detox</p><span class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ ItemsCountIcon-STnPz iUEiRd cMejiB dunaGh items-count__icon gallery">Gallery</span><span class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ ItemsCountContent-gIwYBd iUEiRd jeVEzI gNNffg items-count__content">7 Photos</span><p class="BylineWrapper-jWHrLH eTMkhU byline bylines__byline" data-testid=BylineWrapper itemprop=author itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><span itemprop=name class="BylineNamesWrapper-jbHncj fuDQVo"><span data-testid=BylineName class="BylineName-kwmrLn bGDGPP byline__name"><span class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ BylinePreamble-iJolpQ iUEiRd cBpqA-D hfYXYU byline__preamble">By </span>Lottie Winter</span></span></p><p><span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN hzwRuG button__label">View Gallery</span></p></a><h2>Who should use castor oil?</h2><p>On paper, castor oil sounds like a godsend for acne sufferers. But you wouldn't want to slather a thick layer onto oily spot-prone skin as it's thick and could be pore-clogging. “If you have an oilier skin, use castor oil sparingly,” warns Chelsee. “Because of its anti-inflammatory properties, castor oil will take down redness in acne-prone skin. But it's also a heavier oil so stick to using it once or twice a week to see how your skin reacts.”</p><p>As with all skincare, it comes down to formulation. "Castor oil is safe for anyone to use on the skin in small doses," says Susanne. "For example, 1.5% of the formulation for our Mineral Body Lotion is castor oil. As with any ingredient, it's always best used in moderation." That said, the fatty acids in castor oil will feed dry skin the nutrients and proteins it is craving to stay plump and bouncy.</p><p>There are just two caveats to note. It's always recommended to do a 24-hour patch test by applying a little castor oil on your inner forearm before using it on your face and, if irritation occurs, discontinue use. Castor oil is best avoided during pregnancy as it is thought to induce labour.</p><p>Here are the best castor oil-infused beauty buys to add to your skincare arsenal RN...</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjApqauqp2WtKLGyKecZ5ufY8Kse8aao6Wdoq58qr%2BMnJisrJ%2BnerC1y2aeqKeUYrOwvoysoqKm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
