The V in the bottom half of her dress matched the low one in her torso revealing her delicate cleavage. She held on to the billowy skirt of her creative ensemble which also boasted of a white pleated material draped from each side of her waist. The dress was an optical illusion in itself with the added distraction of Angela’s toned arms and enviable physique.</p><p class=Fg>The 38-year-old kept her hair away from her face with a slicked back look to reveal her large double-hoop earrings and her flawlessly made-up features. Her smile was genuine affirming how she really felt as her caption revealed.</p><p class=Fg>“I always wanted to be a princess,” Angela wrote along with three photos she shared from the event.</p><p class=Fg>It was only in March when the disappointing news of Angela’s split from rapper Common hit the headlines. The CNN commentator who began dating the rapper born Lonnie Corant Jaman Shuka Rashid Lynn Jr. around the summer of last year released a statement through <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://pagesix.com/2018/03/08/common-and-angela-rye-have-broken-up/>Page Six TV</a>, announcing the sad development.</p><p class=Fg>“We have and will always be friends.
