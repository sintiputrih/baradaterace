While he worked for years behind the scenes as a writer on&nbsp;Saturday Night Live,&nbsp;the comic, 40, rose to fame after his debut comedy special&nbsp;New In Town&nbsp;was released.

Not only that but he’s also returned to SNL&nbsp;to host 5 times, making him one of few to host the comedy institution so many times.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>One of the most frequent subjects of his comedy for years was his relationship with his then-wife&nbsp;<strong>Anna Marie Tendler,&nbsp;</strong>37, to who he was wed from 2014 until they separated in 2021. Shortly after their split was announced, it was revealed that John was dating actress <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Olivia Munn,</a>&nbsp;</strong>42, and the pair have an adorable son together.

John joked that he needed to come up with a good excuse to leave the house to pick out an engagement ring. He said he told her that he was going to grab lunch with the&nbsp;Crashing&nbsp;star. He said that he asked Pete not to tweet that they weren’t getting lunch together, but Pete posted a photo about doing a podcast on Instagram. “In fairness to Pete, I said, ‘Don’t tweet anything,'” he quipped.</p><h2>John & Anna got married in 2014</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>The couple tied the knot in July 2014 in a ceremony in Boiceville, New York. Fellow comic <strong>Dan Levy&nbsp;</strong>said the ceremony, as John revealed in his 2015 special&nbsp;The Comeback Kid.&nbsp;In the early years of their marriage, John joked about how happy he was to finally call Anna his wife. “Being married is so nice. I never knew relationships were supposed to make you feel better about yourself,” he said in&nbsp;The Comeback Kid.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>While the pair never had kids, they did own a French bulldog, <strong>Petunia,&nbsp;</strong>who John also included in his act. The comedian even included the pup in the sketch opening&nbsp;The Comeback Kid.&nbsp;During a joke about buying a home, John also said that the pair <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>didn’t want kids</a> in the special.

She works in “photography, textiles, drawing, painting and interior design,” according to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>website</a>. Following her split from the&nbsp;Kid Gorgeous&nbsp;comic, some of her photographic art has garnered a huge audience as works like “Dinner In March” and other pieces from her Rooms in the First House&nbsp;series appeared to reference her relationship and split from John.

After the split, Anna opened up about the heartache and diving into the “Rooms in the First House” series in the Harper’s Bazaar&nbsp;profile. “Everything that has transpired has been totally shocking and I think surreal,” she said. “I had a lot of bad days and medium days. I wouldn’t say I had any good days until the summer.”</p><h2>Who Is John Mulaney Dating Now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/John-Mulaney-Marriage-Evergreen-embed-2-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Shortly after the split from Anna, it was revealed that John was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dating actress</a> Olivia Munn.
