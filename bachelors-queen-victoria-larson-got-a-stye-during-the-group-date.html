Following the date and after a heated disagreement with contestant <strong>Marylynn Sienna</strong>, Victoria, 27, went to sleep on the couch.</p><p>“Girl maybe sleeping on the couch is the reason why you got those bags under your eyes,” a <a href=#>meme account shared</a> after the episode with a photo of her on the couch and another screengrab in which her eye appeared to be swollen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Bachelor-Queen-Victoria-Reveals-She-Got-A-Stye-During-The-Dress-Group-Date-Promo.jpg><p>“Hahahaha the caption I’m crying,” the former flight attendant wrote via her <a href=#>Instagram Story</a> on Wednesday, January 13, when sharing the post. “Nooo, I got a mf stye from the group date!”</p><p>The real estate agent has been making waves on the show since the season 25 premiere when she arrived on a throne wearing a tiara.</p><p>“I’m Victoria, like the queen, and I’m looking for a king with a good heart. So, I heard that’s you, King Matt,” she <a href=#>told the Bachelor, 29, during her entrance</a>. “Queen Victoria is here. I know I’m so confident and so fun, I know I made a good impression, so I just wanna put, like, my best foot forward. … I am the queen of this kingdom.”</p><p>“Marylynn, she’s psychologically disturbed, literally, like I’ll sleep on the couch rather than share a room with Marylynn. I don’t even care,” Victoria said about the event coordinator, 28, at the time. “I’m gonna be with Matt and the rest of it is just, like, ridiculous. I literally am a queen and I can’t wait for Matt to send her home so I have my own room as a queen should.”</p><p>The show <a href=#>cut a scene that explained</a> the feud further, which Victoria later shared via social media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Bachelor-Queen-Victoria-Reveals-She-Got-A-Stye-During-The-Dress-Group-Date-Inline.jpg><p>It didn’t take long for her to become the first villain of the season. During the Monday, January 11 episode, she went head-to-head with Marylynn.</p><p>After the second episode of the season, ABC executive <strong>Robert Mills</strong> spoke out about the show’s villain.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I think that the <a href=#>question is … why is she that way</a>?” he said during the Tuesday, January 13, episode of <a href=#>the “Viall Files” podcast</a>. “There’s always a story for how somebody became that way. … I don’t know that you’ll learn more now on The Bachelor, but I’m very curious about it, so maybe it’s something we’ll have <a href=#><strong>Chris [Harrison]</strong></a> ask about or on <a href=#>Paradise</a>. … I don’t think people are just born this way. … She has a way of dealing with women that is interesting.”</p><p>The Bachelor airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p><strong>Why did Colton Underwood have to stay 100 yards away from Cassie Randolph?
