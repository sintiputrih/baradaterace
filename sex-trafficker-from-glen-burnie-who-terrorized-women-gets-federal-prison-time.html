All of the money she made went directly to Lawton.</p><p>A second victim, who was close friends with the first, failed to perform her "date" the way Lawton required, and in response, he assaulted the first woman in retaliation.</p><p>He also punched another woman, threatened to kill a fourth "routinely," mentioned killing another's family if she tried to leave, and refused to let yet another woman go to the ER when he attacked her.</p><p>Between 2020 and 2022, Lawton deposited almost $100,000 in cash into his bank accounts made from the exploitation and trafficking of his victims, officials said.</p><p>Upon his release from prison, a judge also ordered that Lawton register as a sex offender wherever he works, studies, or lives. He also has to pay restitution to his victims for their losses.</p><p><strong>Want breaking news in the DMV as it happens, or want to contribute?
