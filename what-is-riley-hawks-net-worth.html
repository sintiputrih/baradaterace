This is significantly less than his father Tony, who has an estimated net worth of $140 million but hey, being a millionaire at all is nothing to turn your nose up at!</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=592 data-injectable=true>Just like his father, Riley made most of his money thanks to skateboarding achievements. He officially began his skateboarding career on his 21st birthday, and was declared Skateboarder’s Amateur of the Year on literally the same day. That’s how excited people were to see Tony’s son hit skate parks around the world.</p><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>Skateboarders make the majority of their money through sponsorships, and Riley is sponsored by both Baker Skateboards and Lakai Limited Footwear. He likely also made some of his fortune for licensing his appearance in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">popular video games</a> like Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater HD, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 5, and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2.</p><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=777 data-injectable=false>Outside of skateboarding, Riley also is a front man for the punk band Warish. The band has released one album, Next to Pay, which features 13 songs with its biggest hit being “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Say To Please</a>.” There’s no info publicly available on how much money the band has made, but considering the fact that several styles of the vinyl records pressed for the album have sold out, Warish seems to have a solid number of fans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZaKeuabFjKGYsKOjYrumwIywpqusmGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
