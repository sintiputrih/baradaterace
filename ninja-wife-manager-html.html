Whilst manufacturing her husband's success on the business side of things, she'd still managed to garner her own fandom.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Her fanbase comes mainly from her Dead By Daylight streams, but most people still know her as <a href=# rel=follow>Ninja's wife and manager</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Jessica Blevins Building Her Brand Alongside Husband's</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Jessica clarified she had devoted a significant chunk of her attention to growing her own brand alongside her husband's for a whole year. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She'd mostly stuck to the same strategy she applied when she catapulted her husband from being a streamer with a massive fandom to a bonafide celebrity.&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm really excited," she shared. "I have a PR team. I signed with CAA.&nbsp;Before I was focusing on Tyler, so now I'm focusing on my brand simultaneously."</p><p>That's where the whole separation from the Ninja team stemmed from. She has a book in the works and with her PR agency working tirelessly, a respectable number of offers, no doubt. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>That directly translates to more time needed on her brand and less time available for Ninja.</p><h2>Jessica Blevins Leaving Team Ninja</h2><p>Jessica confessed she was "really torn" at the moment and her devoting all of her time to her own brand was a serious discussion.&nbsp;</p><p>Albeit, she let the outlet know that they were the first in the public sphere to hear about this.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>We’re realizing that there will come a time, and it may come sooner rather than later, that I won’t be his manager anymore.</p><p>She candidly added that with the amount of work that she did for Team Ninja, they would need a full-time replacement for her position, and that person would have to be someone who they can trust.&nbsp;</p><p>Or, as she put it, "Someone who eats, breathes, and sleeps team Ninja like I have done."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Only then could she step down and focus on her own work.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>That being said, she also affirmed that Ninja was "super supportive" and that he simply wanted her to be happy. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>'Sooner Rather than Later' — Not!&nbsp;</h2><p>Understandably, the interview made it sound that Jessica's decision to leave Team Ninja was inbound and imminent, and many outlets reported it as such.&nbsp;</p><p>Just recently, Jessica put up a tweet to set the record straight.&nbsp;</p><p>She addressed all the articles floating around the internet and restated that she would be stepping down from the managerial position in a scenario where her husband gets full focus and time like she'd been giving him.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p dir=ltr lang=en>A lot of articles are speculating after my recent interview.
