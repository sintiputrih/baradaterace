In fact, the second instalment of the story, based on has already been filmed! Producer Jane Tranter was keen to film the first two seasons of the show together so that the main actress in the series, Dafne Keen, would be the same age. Speaking to she explained: "We mainly wanted to make sure that we didn’t wait too long because otherwise by the time we came to film again, [Dafne] could be 18 months older and at that age, you grow up very fast and season two picks up days after season one ends. We had that to consider. The BBC and HBO got that because it takes a year to post-produce."</p><p id=euYT2APMnHTF data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Reese Witherspoon teases Big Little Lies season 3</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/57235dd6d1a9-his-dark-mrs-coulter-z.jpg><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
