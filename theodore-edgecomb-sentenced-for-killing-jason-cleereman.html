It is part of my daily life. I didn’t get a phone call that told me that my husband was killed. I saw it myself. I will forever have the images in my head. They will be ingrained in my memory and they will be replayed in my head over and over for the rest of my life.”</p><p>[Screenshot via WISN]</p><p>Have a tip we should know? <a href=#><span class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=a3d7cad3d0e3cfc2d4c2cdc7c0d1cacec68dc0ccce>[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX6m1prvDqKmeZZWZtKavzqaZZquVo8GmusKem2aen6d6rLXLpaCnn12frrS7zWaapZ2Vp7Kurc1o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
