His in-ring ability and carefree manner on the microphone brought a lot of fans to the table. He is still doing his thing, and not afraid to comment when the mood strikes.</p><p>CM Punk took to social media to playfully mock the official company merch made for ROH Death Before Dishonor, calling it “absolutely not shocking.” The event, held on July 21st, 2023, at the CURE Insurance Arena in Trenton, New Jersey, happened to fall on a Friday. However, the commemorative T-shirt available for the occasion failed to reflect this detail.</p><p>Sharing a photograph on his Instagram Stories, CM Punk humorously captioned it to poke fun at the merchandise’s oversight. He also included a photo of the t-shirt for all to see.</p><p>“Absolute not shocking. How could this happen?”</p><p>AEW messed up the date, as it said Friday, July 21 and not Saturday, July 21. There was an error in its location, too. This t-shirt botch was noticed by a lot of fans, and obviously CM Punk as well.</p><p>AEW has not commented on this shirt yet, but it is another instance how attention to detail is everything. Yes, ROH and AEW hold a lot of events, and it might be easy to get them switched up, but CM Punk isn’t going to really forgive them.</p><p>What’s your take on this AEW t-shirt botch? Sound off in the comments to let us know what you think about things!</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
