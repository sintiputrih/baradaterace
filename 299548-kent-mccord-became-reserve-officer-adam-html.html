And the opposing captain was none other than Elvis Presley.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/28fc92797bb7e9965cc2506dc794c722.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Kent McCord in a promotional shot for "Adam-12" in 1968 in Los Angeles, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Nelson <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.kentmccord.com/bio/index.html>got</a> McCord a part in "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet," and the young man decided to become an actor. After doing stunts, bits, and extra work, McCord signed a contract with Universal. After he appeared as a police officer in "Dragnet 1967," Jack Webb would cast McCord in "Adam-12," arguably his biggest role to this day. Speaking about what made the show great, McCord <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.boomermagazine.com/kent-mccord-of-adam-12-on-his-career/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>“The charm of ‘Adam-12’ was its simplicity.

The writers returned to writing each episode depicting a day in the life of the two characters. This format of police drama is much more common today in shows like "BlueBloods" and the famous "Law and Order" franchise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/146abd7b1e52ccf9190f7d16fcabdaa4.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Kent Mccord withKent McCord and Cynthia Doty at the 75th Anniversary Celebration at Rockefeller Plaza in May 5, 2002 in New York City. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The show thrust McCord into the spotlight.
