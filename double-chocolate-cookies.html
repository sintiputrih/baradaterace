They are a mix between a soft, chewy brownie and the most decadent, rich chocolate cookie.</p><p>As you may know, I take my cookie recipes very seriously and have been baking for over 40 years! My favorite thing to bake is homemade cookies and these double chocolate chocolate chip cookies may rank in my top cookie recipes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Double-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-10.jpg><p>This double chocolate chocolate chip cookie recipe is super easy to make and is made with simple ingredients. You will be hooked on these chocolate cookies, I promise!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Double-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-5.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ingredients>Ingredients</h2><ul><li><strong>Butter</strong>: Most bakers swear by unsalted butter because it is usually fresher (since salt is used as a preservative) and you can control the amount of salt in the cookies. If you have salted butter on hand that you want to use, I would suggest reducing the salt to 1/4 teaspoon.</li><li><strong>Brown sugar</strong>: I generally use light brown sugar for this recipe, but dark would work as well. Make sure to pack down the brown sugar in the measuring cup for an accurate measurement.</li><li><strong>Granulated white sugar</strong>: Most recipes will call for regular granulated sugar, which works great. However, if you prefer having a creamier, silky smooth butter-sugar mixture, you can use superfine sugar. Buy it online or make your own by pulsing regular granulated sugar in a food processor for 10 seconds.</li><li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Always use large eggs. If you can, bring them to room temperature. In a pinch, hold them under a stream of warm/hot water for about 30 seconds.</li><li><strong>Vanilla</strong>: I suggest using pure vanilla extract rather than imitation vanilla flavoring. A good, high-quality vanilla can make a difference in the flavor of baked goods. My go-to quality vanilla is Nielsen-Massey pure vanilla extract, Mexican vanilla, or vanilla bean paste.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/cold.jpg><ul><li><strong>Cocoa powder</strong>: I suggest using unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder.</li><li><strong>Flour</strong>: Most of my cookie recipes use all-purpose flour, with a few exceptions (like my <a href=#>Levain Bakery chocolate chip cookies</a>, which are a mix of both all-purpose and cake flour). These double chocolate chip cookies use all-purpose flour for structure and texture.</li><li><strong>Baking soda</strong>: This is what gives the cookies their “lift”. When baking soda is mixed with an acidic ingredient (such as brown sugar, buttermilk, sour cream, etc), oxygen and carbon combine to form carbon dioxide. This creates tiny bubbles that lift the dough and gives baked goods the loft we are looking for. It also promotes browning.</li><li><strong>Salt</strong>: A necessity in all cookies! It enhances flavor and balances out the sweetness. It really makes all the difference.</li><li><strong>Chocolate chips</strong>: Depending on your preference you can use semi-sweet chocolate chips, milk chocolate, or a mix of both.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Double-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-9.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What type of cocoa powder is best for baking?</h3><p>Cocoa Powder comes in natural and Dutch versions. Dutch raises the cocoa powder’s pH levels, which neutralizes its acids and rounds out its flavor. Both natural and Dutch cocoa will work in recipes. Dutch-processed cocoa will produce baked goods with a darker color and moister texture.</p><p>My favorite cocoa powder to use is Dutch-process cocoa powder. I love to use Callebaut Dutched Cocoa Powder. It has a warmer color with reddish-brown notes. It is slightly sweeter than the dark dutch cocoa powder. I find this unsweetened cocoa powder in the bulk section at Winco. It is much less expensive at Winco than you can find online.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Double-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-1.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What kind of chocolate chips are best for baking?</h3><p>It really comes down to personal preference!</p><p>I usually use semi-sweet chocolate chips, but a close second is milk chocolate when I want the cookies to be sweeter. My personal favorite brands to use in cookies are Guittard, Ghirardelli, and Trader Joe’s.</p><p>I prefer the Guittard Milk Chocolate Chips for their rich, creamy flavor and the Ghirardelli Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips. Trader Joe’s chocolate chips are slightly larger in size and have a decadent chocolate flavor. You can also use their Pound Plus Chocolate Bars and cut those into chocolate chunks if you want a more melty and gooey chocolate.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-instructions>Instructions</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Double-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-Creaming-Butter-and-Sugars.jpg><p>Start by creaming together softened butter, brown sugar, and white sugar in a stand mixer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Double-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-Mixing-Cookie-Dough.jpg><p>After adding all ingredients, the dough should be thick and dark.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Double-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-Cooking-Cookie-Dough-Balls-on-Baking-Sheet.jpg><p>Role or scoop dough into balls.

Let sit for 5 minutes before removing from the pan.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How to make the Best Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookies:</h3><ul><li><strong>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees</strong>. Start out by mixing together the butter and sugars in a standing mixer. It should take about 4 minutes, and the mixture will turn from a yellow sandy color to a light and fluffy ivory color. This shows that enough air has been incorporated.</li><li><strong>Add in eggs, then vanilla, then mix for another 1 minute</strong>, making sure to scrape the sides of the bowl.</li><li><strong>Stir in flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt</strong>. Be careful not to over-mix. Fold in chocolate chips.</li><li><strong>Roll dough into balls and place on a baking sheet</strong> lined with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</li><li><strong>Don’t overbake the cookies</strong>. The double chocolate cookies will continue to set up once the cookies are pulled from the oven.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Double-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-3.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>TIP: Make your cookies look like they’re from a bakery</h3><p>If you want your cookies to look more “gourmet”, add chocolate chips on top of and around the cookie dough balls before baking. You can also press chocolate chips into the cookies right after pulling them out of the oven, when they’re still soft.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-variations>Variations</h2><p>Try keeping the cookie dough base the exact same, then mix up the flavor by adding different kinds of chocolate chips and other mix-ins.</p><ul><li><strong>Triple Chocolate Chip Cookies</strong> – add 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 cup of white chocolate chips</li><li><strong>Peanut Butter Chocolate Cookies</strong> – replace chocolate chips with peanut butter chips or chopped up peanut butter candies (such as Reeses)</li><li><strong>Double Chocolate Chip Cookies</strong> – to make these cookies sweeter, you can add milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet chocolate.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-equipment>Equipment</h2><p>The equipment you use when baking can have a huge impact on how your recipe turns out.</p><p>Although not completely necessary, I have found my <a href=#>KitchenAid</a> to be my best friend when baking cookies! It allows you to work on other things while the ingredients are being creamed together, plus it combines the ingredients more thoroughly than by hand.</p><p>I also swear by these light-colored baking sheets and parchment paper baking sheets. They help keep the bottoms of your cookies from overbaking or browning too quickly.</p><p>Some other helpful tools would be measuring cups and spoons, a spatula set, and a turner. This cookie scoop forms the perfect-sized cookies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Double-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-12.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>TIP: Use thick, light colored baking sheets</h3><p>I suggest using a heavy-gauge aluminum pan. If you use a dark-colored baking sheet, the heat from the oven is attracted to the dark color and the bottoms of the cookies will cook faster and may become too brown and burn before the center of the cookie is baked through.&nbsp;</p><p>Heavy, thick baking sheets conduct heat differently than thin ones do. If you don’t have a thick baking sheet, you can try stacking two thin ones and baking on those.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-storage>Storage</h2><p>Keep the cookies in an airtight container to keep them fresher for a longer period of time. If you want to freeze them, you can put them in large airtight freezer bags until ready to eat.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-top-tip>Top tip</h2><p>Check your oven temperature using an oven thermometer. Oven temperatures can vary which can affect the baking times.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Double-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-8.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-faq>FAQ</h2><strong class=schema-faq-question>What is the secret to making cookies soft?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>The simplest answer to this is to make sure not to overbake your cookies! If you want soft cookies, I suggest setting the timer for 1-2 minutes less than the suggested baking time so you can check the cookies.&nbsp;</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>Do I really need to use a cooling rack for my cookies?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>As soon as the cookies are firm enough, transfer them to a wire cooling rack. This allows air to circulate so that the cookies keep a perfectly crisp exterior and chewy center. It also keeps the cookies from turning soggy.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>Why are my cookies flat?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>There are a couple of reasons why your cookies could be flat and running together on the pan.</p><p>1. Not enough flour in the cookie dough. Make sure to use the “dip and sweep” method when measuring out your flour. Dip your measuring cup into the flour and lightly brush a knife over the top to make it flat. Do NOT pack your flour into the measuring cup!</p><p>2. The butter might be too soft. The recipe calls for “softened” butter, which means you should be able to leave a slight indent in it with your finger. I suggest leaving your butter out at room temperature for 30 minutes to an hour or putting it in the microwave for 7-8 seconds.</p><p>3. <strong>You are baking on hot baking sheets</strong>. It is important to not bake cookies on hot baking sheets or it will make the butter melt, which will result in the dough spreading too much when baked. If you are baking multiple batches, wash your baking sheet in cool water or place ice on the baking sheet to cool it down.</p><p>4. <strong>Cookies may be too close together</strong>. Place the cookies at least 2 inches apart from one another. This allows the air to properly circulate around the cookies so that they bake evenly. After baking, you can always use a small spatula to form the cookies into a rounder shape and keep them from touching one another.</p><p>I hope you love these rich, velvety, melt-in-your-mouth chocolate cookies with melted chocolate chunks.

True story. I would spend the night at my neighbor’s home and we would wait until her parents went to bed to go on a secret cookie stealing mission.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Double-Chocolate-Cookies-1.jpg><p>They had this trolley cookie jar filled with cookies but there was a strict policy about how many cookies we could eat. One was never enough and it didn’t satisfy our cravings so we had to take some drastic measures.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>As the lights went out and we were sure they are sound asleep, we would quietly crawl through the kitchen. The funny part about it is that we tried so hard to be quiet which made us start to laugh and we could keep shushing each other.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>It was all very counterproductive.</p><p>Now the difficult part was lifting off the heavy top of the trolley cookie jar. It was loud and cumbersome and remember it was pitch black. But it was worth the risk and we were up for the challenge! Cookies were the reward so we were all in.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>We would grab as many cookies as possible, fill up our shirts, and then somehow crawl back into her room, to devour the cookies in peace.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Double-Chocolate-Cookies-3.jpg><p>All was well and good until the morning. We may have meticulously thought out our plan to confiscate the cookies but we didn’t think about what would happen when her Mom would check the cookie jar and see if was basically empty. Well, that didn’t go well and we had to fess up. I couldn’t tell a lie. So our covers were blown and there was no more of the middle-of-the-night cookie sneaking. <span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Basically, cookies have been my favorite food since the time I was little.
