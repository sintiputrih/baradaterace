She once testified that Depp and her father did drugs together at their engagement party in 2014. She claimed that the actor had "disappeared upstairs" the entire party and "only came down at the end when we were leaving, and came down once because he was at the time sharing drugs with my dad." <a href=#>The Pirates of the Caribbean star</a>'s lawyer called an objection of speculation. Heard continued, saying: "I was there. I watched it. My dad at the same time was addicted to the same thing Johnny was."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also said that at some point, either Depp or her father "ran out" of drugs during the party. "My dad actually left with Johnny's security," said the actress, adding that they soon came back with drugs "and everything was okay." Depp allegedly "snapped at" Heard when she confronted him about it. "Shortly after that, I tried to get Johnny to come downstairs, and he just snapped at me, just verbally told me to shut the f*** up. And I remember talking to my mom about the irony of it," she recalled. "That was pretty much it for the engagement party, and I went downstairs and entertained guests and smiled and took pictures and put on a face and you know, went about my eating."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In one of Depp's testimonies, he said that Heard threw a large bottle of vodka at him during a fight. He then cut his fingertip which Heard previously denied, saying that the actor cut it himself during a three-day bender. Her team also released a photo of Depp passed out on a couch with melting ice cream on his pants was displayed in the proceedings.</p><p>But Depp's lawyer, Ben Rottenborn showed the jury a text message he sent Heard's mother in 2014. He praised the actress for supporting him through his Oxycodone detox. "I don't need to explain the horrors to you," Depp wrote. "Your daughter has risen far above the nightmarish task of taking care of this poor old junkie. Never a second has gone by that she didn't look out for me or have her eyes on me to make sure that I was OK."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Amber Heard ‘Bloody Lip’ Pic Surfaces But Johnny Depp’s Team Cries Foul</a></span></p><h2 id=amber-heard-39-s-mother-said-the-domestic-abuse-claims-are-false>Amber Heard's Mother Said The Domestic Abuse Claims Are False</h2><p>In resurfaced messages, Heard's mother, Paige admitted that the domestic abuse claims against Depp weren't her daughter's idea. The matriarch accused the actress' lawyers of orchestrating the whole thing. She even texted Depp that her daughter didn't "willingly or happily" file for a restraining order. Paige also blamed the lawyers "on both sides" for "frigging things up." She wrote: "It's the lawyers on both sides doing this not Amber. I heard the whole story very teary—if I could just talk to Johnny. She didn't want this. Friggin' lawyers on BOTH sides!!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"This was not her idea, not her wishes. She was told she would be evicted and out in 30 days if she did not do this," she added in her texts in May 2016. "Her dumb lawyer possibly as the only way she would have a place to live in 30 days. She DID NOT want to do this I swear to you. The lawyers are frigging things up." <a href=#>The Edward Scissorhands star</a> replied, asking why Heard would "go to the courthouse with a photo of her that looks like she's been abused?"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Johnny Depp Abused Ex Kate Moss, Amber Heard Claims</a></span></p><p>"This is my life too, what are my children and my children's friends supposed to think??? I do not deserve this, and they do not deserve this... especially not from her," Depp added. Paige responded, saying the lawyers asked the actress to do so. "I'll swear to you this was not her idea nor did she do it willingly or happily. She was told it was her ONLY option to not be kicked out," she wrote. "I'm not making excuses but that is what she believed. She did not want to do it. She felt she was betraying her only love but the lawyers said so. Please don't pass this on if you ever talk to Amber again. I love you, son."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Which Actress Did Amber Heard Replace In 'Pineapple Express'?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dlrqjsdFmn56ZopnAbrzAq5ynrKNiwaatzGahqKCeo8ZusMSpp2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
