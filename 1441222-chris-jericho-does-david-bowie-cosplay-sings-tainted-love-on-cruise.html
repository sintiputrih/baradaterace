He had recently been <a href=#>interviewed</a> by WFAA. During the interview, Jericho shared how he manages being a wrestler, a singer, and an actor all at the same time.</p><p>“So yeah, I mean, so you kind of go into it with that attitude, that idea. And I’ve done actually quite a few movies over the last year or two, it’s kind of…that world is opening up now a little bit more as well,” Chris Jericho said. “So it’s all timing, you know? I mean, I couldn’t really do a lot of acting in the 2000s, 2010s because I was working four days a week with WWE, and then Fozzy comes into play.</p><p>“And that kind of takes up a lot of time too. But now, with AEW, we work basically once a week. I mean, sometimes it’s two, but most of the time it’s one. So it gives you a lot more time to do Fozzy tours. And that’s [why] the band has grown as much as we have, or to do more acting, which is why we’ve done five movies in the last year, maybe six, something like that. So yeah, it’s all timing and just keeping the plates spinning in a way that you can make everything work.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-chris-jericho-on-his-role-in-the-film-macgruber>Chris Jericho on his role in the film MacGruber</h2><p>The Ocho also shared his experience in acting in the film MacGruber.</p><p>“Funny thing about that is that, that was quite a lot of improv,” Chris Jericho revealed. “Will Forte was also a groundling. And typical Jericho, when they asked me to do the part, I was like, ‘Well, I’ll only do it if there’s lines.’</p><p>“And so they had some lines. I was like, ‘That’s not enough lines. I’m just going to improv with him.’ And either he’ll go with it, or he won’t. And either the director will like it or he won’t. They could just say, ‘Hey Chris, stick to the script,’ or ‘That’s great, let’s do it again.’ And so that’s what we did, improv. I mean, it was a short scene, but it would have been a lot shorter had I not thrown a couple lines at him.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNtaGtqYmKwqb7IrGSjnaKesKm7jJ2mnqtdma63tcNmmaivmZp6pLvSqaOasV2otq%2Bz0marmqGeqbKlecuorZ5ln6N6pL7Uoqqe</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
