So, like many other players, Dwight turned to international basketball and signed with the Taoyuan Leopards of the T1 League in Taiwan on Nov. 7, 2022.</p><p>"I am so so excited, and I can't wait to touch down in Taiwan and start playing," he said as part of a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">social media post by the team</a>. "I'm coming with open arms, with big hugs, and big smiles."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What team does Dwight Howard play for now?</h2><p>As of now, Dwight Howard is part of the Taoyuan Leopards â€” but will it stay that way? On Apr. 23, 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Focus Taiwan</a> reported that the former NBA superstar's contract would expire sometime in May 2023. The Leopards can negotiate a new deal, but the club's CEO, Johnny Chang, said Dwight is "keen to test the market."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"It's been unfortunate that I haven't had a call from the NBA about playing with a team, but that's why I think it's great that I'm [in Taiwan]," he said during a January 2023 appearance on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBA Today</a>. "I'm able to hone in on my skills even more, work on things to really bring more life to my game."</p><p>He continued, "If I was to get that call, I'm pretty sure that an NBA team would not be disappointed with the effort and energy and tenacity that I could bring â€” and the leadership that I could bring. Until that day, I'm gonna continue to be the best teammate, the best leader I could be for [the Leopards], and push myself to the max every single minute."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But as of recently, it seems Dwight is planning to stay in Taiwan; on May 16, 2023, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">called out</a> underperforming NBA players and told them to join him in Taiwan.
