The continuation, written and directed by <strong>Nancy Meyers</strong>, benefitted World Central Kitchen, which provides meals for kids and families impacted by the coronavirus crisis.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong></a> introduced the segment, which saw Matty marrying his fiancé, Rachel (<a href=#><strong>Alexandra Shipp</strong></a>), via Zoom. Annie’s son, George (<strong>Ben Platt</strong>), George and Nina’s youngest daughter, Megan (<strong>Florence Pugh</strong>), and Rachel’s dad (<a href=#><strong>Robert De Niro</strong></a>) joined the festivities as Franck officiated the nuptials.</p><p>Fans also received updates on the Banks. Matty is a comedy writer, George is retired and the family never actually moved out of their beloved colonial home.</p><p>Netflix teased in a trailer released on Thursday, September 24, that the reunion would be set in 2020. “George, we’re all here, come on. George, Matty said it was important,” Keaton’s Nina yelled, to which Martin’s character replied, “I’m just washing my hands. One more ‘Happy Birthday’ to go!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Father-of-the-Bride-3-Cast.png><p>Newbern, 55, hinted in October 2017 that a third movie could come to fruition in the near future. “[Director] <strong>Charles Shyer</strong> wrote a script. I know <a href=#>there’s a script out there</a>. And there’s talk,” the actor exclusively told&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;at the time. “I don’t know how far it got but I’m sure most of the cast would be into it if the script was right. So maybe that’s just a question of that happening.”</p><p>He added: “I have heard some [concepts] and they are pretty far out there. From what I heard it was pretty good and different and newsworthy.”</p><p>Williams-Paisley, 49, for her part, reflected on her life-changing role in April 2017. “Almost every day, people tell me that&nbsp;Father of the Bride&nbsp;is part of their history,” she wrote in an essay for <a href=#>ABC News</a>. “Fathers see the film with their daughters and weep over memories of long ago backyard basketball scrimmages. Brides watch it as a rite of passage before their wedding day. Couples often romanticize it as ‘their movie.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The actress then revealed the piece of advice Martin, 75, gave her during filming for the first movie: “Welcome to Hollywood. You’re going to need a good therapist.”</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ2arJiav267xWaroZ1dl7%2BqsMRmmpqrpGK%2FpsHNoqueq12bvLN5z5qprWVjYrqqushmqp6ppZq5cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
