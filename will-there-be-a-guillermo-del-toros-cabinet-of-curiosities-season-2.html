The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">anthology series</a> has earned wide-spread critical acclaim and fanfare. But will that be enough to propel Cabinet of Curiosities into a renewal for another season? Right now, only time will tell.</p><h2 id=h-will-there-be-a-season-2-of-guillermo-del-toro-s-cabinet-of-curiosities data-injectable=false>Will there be a season 2 of Guillermo del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities?</h2><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=726 data-injectable=true>Guillermo del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities had a stellar first season, so will there be a second one in the works? Sadly, we don’t know right now. There has been no official word from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a> on whether or not Cabinet of Curiosities will be renewed for a second season. It’s possible that Season 2 is eventually released, but we currently have no way of knowing if this is true.</p><p data-characters=522 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=false>While many fans want there to be a second season of Guillermo del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities, fan desires don’t always win out when it comes to Netflix shows. There have been many <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled Netflix series</a> that had tons of viewers and fans behind it. It seems like even when a show is doing well, Netflix may sometimes cancel or fail to renew the series for a myriad of reasons. Many of those reasons are kept from the public, which doesn’t help audiences predict whether or not a renewal will happen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tculZK2glaeybq7EZphmn6Weua2x0aamZpyVoXq1u9GoqmabkZe2r7HTZqafZZOqv6q70qKrop2jYsCmrdKopWZqXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
