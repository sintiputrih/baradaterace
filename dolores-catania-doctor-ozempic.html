"I wasn't going to come to [the Housewives] reunion looking bigger than anyone else," she said.</p><p>Catania isn't the first celebrity—or housewife—<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>to admit to taking Ozempic</a>, but <strong>Rocio Salas-Whalen</strong>, MD, claimed there are medical reasons why a patient may be prescribed the drug.

She reasoned that appearance alone isn't the sole factor in deciding if a patient needs to go on Ozempic or Mounjaro for weight loss.</p><p>"Whenever we see somebody that we may think they don't need the medication, unless you're their doctor, you don't know their medical history," she told TODAY.com. "You don't know what medications they're taking, you don't know their internal health and the reasoning for a patient … to be on this type of medication."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/Dolores-Catania-black-dress.jpg><p>While Salas-Whalen refrained from sharing Catania's medical history, she explained menopause and perimenopause come "with many health complications" for middle-aged women—specifically, weight gain, and loss.</p><p>"Menopause comes with many health complications. There's a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dementia—and if you add to that mix being overweight or having obesity, then we increase the risk for disease for the patient," she said.</p><p>"Entering menopause (at) a healthy weight is very preventative for long-term complications from aging and weight and menopause," Salas-Whalen added.

"I'm going through menopause, I have a thyroid issue, I have inflammation, and weight is hard to take off," she shared.</p><p>Despite her healthy lifestyle, the RHONJ star said she was still "gaining weight." Thus, she sought out a medical opinion. "I work out, and I don't eat crazy, and I was gaining weight, and it's a lot of different layers. … Let's just let everybody know," she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/Jackie-Goldschneider.jpg><p>Jackie Goldschneider, who has shared her battle with anorexia on RHONJ, has been very transparent about her thoughts about the weight loss drug.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>"I'm very, very scared of what will happen if and when people have to go off of this drug, because it's just going to be like a massive number of people who gain a huge amount of weight and suddenly don't know what to do with themselves," she said on <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Virtual Reali-Tea</a>. "I'm just afraid of that day—there's going to be a lot of people with eating disorders."</p><p>As an eating disorder survivor, Goldschneider said she understands how "addicting" having a thinner appearance can be. She fears that will transpire into an eating disorder for some as it did for her. "That's so addicting. I mean, that's how I spiraled into anorexia. You get addicted to this new body and to the attention that comes with it," she said.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Chelsea Handler Didn't Know She Was Taking Ozempic: "My Doctor Hands It Out to Anybody"</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/Margaret-Josephs-1.jpg><p>Catania isn't the only one of her RHONJ castmates who's using the weight loss drug to slim down. During an appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, newcomer <strong>Jen Fessler</strong> shared that she "took peptides" to "lose a lot of weight," (via <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Page Six</a>). She also got a facelift and nose job. When asked if she was on Ozempic, Fessler quipped, "You said it, I didn't. But…whatever works, here I am."</p><p><strong>Margaret Josephs </strong>(pictured above), who's a close friend of Catania's, admitted to taking peptides and hormone-replacement therapy to drop weight. "It's been life-changing," she told <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>People</a> of her 22-pound weight loss.
