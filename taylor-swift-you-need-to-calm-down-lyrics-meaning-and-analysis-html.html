Now she’s back with a second upbeat, Pride-parade-on-roids-sounding single, “<a href=#>You Need to Calm Down</a>.” Written by Swift and Joel Little, the song has mazelike lyrics that sent fans into a tizzy, proving once and for all that my favorite pop star has the one thing I’ve always feared most: Big Riddle Energy. Let’s decode this beast together, line by line.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjwwgmxq000262a6glbl9ub7n@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Verse 1:</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjwwgp1zk002b2a6g5qwta0xt@published data-word-count=7><strong>“You are somebody that I don’t know”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjwwgqboz002g2a6gyy6eytjd@published data-word-count=13>Ew.

You’re subtweeting me, but what’s this really about? Is this really about the mean comment, or is this about yourself and your own insecurities? In my opinion, the overall message of the first verse is simply: Stop bullying. As Swift explained in a video to her fans on <a href=#>social media</a>, “I’ve observed a lot of different people in our society who put so much energy and effort into negativity, and it made me feel like, ‘You need to just calm down.’”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjwwgw8hj002u2a6g73lhc1i1@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Pre-chorus</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjwwgx70l002z2a6g5710csos@published data-word-count=8><strong>“And I ain’t tryna mess with your self-expression”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjwwgxgih00342a6gtukv7iuc@published data-word-count=15>She’s like, “Do you, brother.

The two pop superstars <a href=#>Instagrammed together two days ago</a>. Swift announced “You Need to Calm Down” the following day (yesterday), before dropping it at midnight, and please remember that everything Taylor does is meticulously calculated with surgical precision. She and Katy used to stress and obsess over each other’s business, but it’s over now. She rose above.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjwwgxgil00372a6g60js2vuv@published data-word-count=8><strong>“And snakes and stones never broke my bones”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjwwgxgim00382a6gcarog9dy@published data-word-count=59>This play on words is an obvious reference to her Snake era, a.k.a. the reputation album, which was painted with snake iconography (see: the “Look What You Made Me Do” <a href=#>video</a>).

But also this is definitely a reference to the time Aretha Franklin apocalyptically <a href=#>shaded</a> Taylor. When pressed for her opinions on her successors, Franklin had nice things to say about Alicia Keys and Adele, but when asked about Taylor, all she had to say was “Great gowns. Beautiful gowns.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjwwh355n003t2a6ghnbwtib7@published data-word-count=5><strong>“You need to calm down”</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjwwh355n003u2a6gqjkw97mj@published data-word-count=10>Everyone take a collective breath.

For background: There is a faction of lesbian Tumblr, <a href=#>the Kaylor shippers</a>, who believe Taylor Swift and former BFF Karlie Kloss were romantically involved. When “ME!” dropped in April, fans theorized about a string of clues that led Kaylors to believe Swift was finally coming out with it — either an admission that she did indeed bone Jared Kushner’s sister-in-law or was coming out. So there’s a sector of the internet waiting to pop the absolute fuck off at any slight mention of gayness.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjwwh5e9k004d2a6g9zypm5gh@published data-word-count=90>Here, Swift purposely spelled glad with two A’s, referring to pro-LGBTQ media organization GLAAD (Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation). Since the beginning of Pride Month, Swift has been super pro-gay-rights. She recently <a href=#>made</a> a generous donation to GLAAD and <a href=#>wrote</a> a letter to her senator asking him to support the Equality Act, urging her fans to do the same. I remember being so truculently pro-gay-rights moments before I came out that all my friends were like, “We’re pro-LGBT too, but like … you, good?” Just sayin’.

I found my timeline speckled with little Taylor Swift avatars tweeting that this moment was (for the second time this album cycle) for sure when Swift <a href=#>came out</a>. Some said this was her <a href=#>first step</a> in the coming-out process. Other fans, who think with reason rather than their own lesbianism (unlike the Kaylors and myself), insisted that Swift was just calling out homophobes, <a href=#>saying</a>, “Gay people will still be gay, no matter how much you yell that you hate them.” Regardless, it was jarring to hear Swift say the word gay out loud after months of our praying to the Lesbian Goddess that she’d come out in the Lover era.
