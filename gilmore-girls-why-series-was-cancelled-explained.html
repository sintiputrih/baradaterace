The heartwarming comedy-drama came to an end after seven seasons before being revived by Netflix for a four-part miniseries almost a decade later."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, <strong>the two leading ladies' contracts came to an end after seven seasons, </strong>meaning that they needed to be negotiated beyond that.</p><p id=eHJ3RwVPYZ5L data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a aria-label="The truth behind Gilmore Girls stars Lauren Graham and Scott Patterson's feud" class=hm-link href=#>The truth behind Gilmore Girls stars Lauren Graham and Scott Patterson's feud</a></strong></p><p id=e9VH9-LIQK_n data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a aria-label="Gilmore Girls then vs now: See how the cast has changed over the years" class=hm-link href=#>Gilmore Girls then vs now: See how the cast has changed over the years</a></strong></p><p id=erDGYzAZC-h4 data-wc=63>As a result, while conversations took place behind the scenes, showrunner David S. Rosenthal planned a finale that "could serve as an ending or a beginning of a new chapter and a new season". Filming went ahead before anything was fully decided, meaning that the cast and crew of the show had no idea whether they were filming for the very final time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1c2b06650336-gilmore-girls-orig-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=es8ru_Vygx2B data-wc=8><strong>The comedy-drama originally aired between 2000 and 2007</strong></p><p id=e8ugaep_RlmG data-wc=74>Sadly though, they were and they didn't have a final wrap party or an opportunity to say farewells to each other - or the show's beloved set on the Warner Brothers. Lauren explained that the possibility of returning fell through because "we were trying to find a way we [she and Bledel] could have a slightly easier schedule, and there was really no way to do that and still have it be Gilmore Girls."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fbe82e5ab0d5-gilmore-girls-lauren-alexis-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eFBp7G03xol4 data-wc=15><strong>Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel tried to negotiate their contracts but ended up walking away</strong></p><p id=eeXs58VpVUtx data-wc=45>The show ended with Lorelai and Luke's relationship back on after her spontaneous and short-lived marriage to Christopher came to an end. Rory, meanwhile, graduated from Yale and began her dream job at the cost of her relationship with boyfriend Logan, whose proposal she rejected.</p><p id=eVgM2_WrVG1n data-wc=45>However, it's worth mentioning that the finale was not exactly what creator Amy Sherman-Palladino had in mind. The show's mastermind and her co-showrunner husband, Daniel Sherman-Palladino, departed the show at the end of season six after their own contract negotiations with The CW broke down.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/86ade9552a1e-gilmore-girls-revival-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eP5gB0gnYNcx data-wc=10><strong>The show returned in 2016 with a new Netflix miniseries</strong></p><p id=e64lKP12Ljrq data-wc=74>The creative duo got their redemption when they penned their "ending" as part of the Netflix revival series, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life which they were able to oversee. Amy admittedly has never watched the original ending, so concocted a storyline for her characters that fit in with what she originally planned for them - and ignored many of the events that went down in season seven that she did not like.</p><p id=eqYGE-bFD1Ja data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a aria-label="7 shows to watch if you love Gilmore Girls" class=hm-link href=#>7 shows to watch if you love Gilmore Girls</a></strong></p><p id=eKitpSYSkv4E data-wc=67>However, the "full circle" moment that the creators had long teased to fans - Rory revealing to her mom that she had fallen pregnant - didn't land exactly right due to the time that had passed. Instead of being a fresh college graduate, Rory is a 30-something, and as a result, the moment doesn't bears any resemblance to Lorelai's own discovery that she was pregnant at 16.</p><p id=eUmyQ42r22HU data-wc=44>While viewers have their own mixed feelings about how the original series ended, many believe it stays truer to Rory's persona and are very glad that the Sherman-Palladino's pregnancy storyline didn't feature in the original run - and we have to say we agree.</p><p id=eQQu6Cu3v3x1 data-wc=4><strong>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
