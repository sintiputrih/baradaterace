She completed her bridal look with a long lace veil, and carried a big bouquet of bright flowers.</p><p id=eou_z1zKBS3u data-wc=23>Her handsome groom, meanwhile, looked dapper in a navy suit, while proud dad Kevin opted for a tan suit with a navy tie.</p><p id=em3bCbo71uH4 data-wc=36>Also present at the wedding ceremony was Annie's mum Cindy. She was married to Kevin for 16 years, from 1978 until 1994, and the former couple have three children together; Annie, Lily, 29, and Joe, 28.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3763df5c22f5-costner1-z.jpg><p class=text-center id=elLI8ZUZdac9 data-wc=11><strong>The star with daughters Annie and Lily, and his wife Christine</strong></p><p id=erKpuWkEruFL data-wc=27>Kevin has been married to Christine Baumgartner since September 2004, and they are parents to three children; sons Cayden, nine, and seven-year-old Hayes, and daughter Grace, six.</p><p id=emgWGN8wHj00 data-wc=15>The star also has a son Liam, 19, from his previous relationship with Bridget Rooney.</p><p id=eOM5-3jPo9zG data-wc=64>Earlier this year, Kevin opened up about his youngest children during an appearance on the show. "I think there's a lot to be said with how you're raised – we're at all the Little League games, we're in that car constantly, we're trying to get the kids on the same team so we won't have to go to three different practices!" he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c7180bcc3bd0-costner2-a.jpg><p class=text-center id=eSCNPV46sA77 data-wc=7><strong>Kevin and Christine have three children together</strong></p><p id=e5gKfsx26A4a data-wc=42>"So poor little Hayes, who's in the middle, is having to play with eight and nine-year-olds and he's like seven, but he can hack it. So there's gonna be this point where he's gonna go 'Why was I always forced into leagues?'"</p><p id=eC5FlheqjRPh data-wc=46>Grace, however, isn't really into athletics: "She's my girly girl," Kevin said. "She's sewing and she's dancing, but when she sees the ball bouncing out in the backyard I can feel her gravitating out with the boys — but everything has to stop when she plays."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
