Below Deck viewers will recall Camille referred to herself as a small-town girl from Mississippi on the premiere episode.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Larry Brown Sports</a> says Camille and Shea were together in 2016 as it discusses his help in upsetting Texas A&M that year.</p><p>They were still together in 2017, as Camille shared a Facebook post thanking Shea for celebrating her birthday with her. The couple reportedly broke up when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shea transferred to the University of Michigan.</a></p><p>After graduation, Shea signed with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2020, but his career was short-lived. By July of that year, Shea was waivered and became a free agent. These days, Shea plays in the USLF league for the Michigan Panthers.</p><p>Football wasn’t Shea’s only sport, either. Major League Baseball team <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Texas Rangers signed him</a> in the 39th round. Despite signing a six-year contract, Shea has not played baseball for them or anyone else since his high school days.</p><p>In terms of his personal life, Shea appears to keep that under wraps.
