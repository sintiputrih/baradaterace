After welcoming three sons, and nearly 13 years of marriage, Gwen and Gavin announced their separation, shocking fans. It was revealed that their relationship had been strained for some time, leading to their decision to part ways. The couple officially divorced in 2016.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Since then, the exes remain relatively tight-lipped about their co-parenting… or lack thereof, according to Gavin. “I think you can go one of two ways — you can either do everything together and really co-parent, and see how that goes — or you can just parent,” he said on Thursday’s podcast. “And I think we just parent.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gavin-rossdale-kids-gwen-stefani-raise-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Gavin’s sentiment appeared to line up with a source who <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>EXCLUSIVELY</a> told <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>HollywoodLife </strong></a>that Gavin and Gwen “don’t have a relationship except for the kids” and “communicate as minimal as possible.” The insider added that Gavin wasn’t “phased” by Gwen’s second marriage to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Blake Shelton </strong></a>and there was “zero surprise” about him not being included in their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wedding ceremony</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>While the British musician waxed on about being a father, he has another role to consider now: that of grandfather! Gavin’s daughter <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Daisy Lowe</strong></a>, whom he shares with his ex <strong>Pearl Lowe</strong>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed a daughter</a> with her partner <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jordan Saul </strong></a>in April. While Gavin has yet to publicly remark on becoming a grandfather, it seems likely he’ll be over-the-moon for his daughter, as he commented on the pregnancy news in October with a string of three red heart emojis.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Meanwhile, Gavin recently posted a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rare photo of himself</a> with all four of his children on his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. “Welcome to my world,” he wrote. “The best few weeks at home with my better versions of me.
