I love the sport."&nbsp;</p><h2>Sue Barker's surprise return</h2><p id=ef1R4SmG4k data-wc=63><a class=hm-link href=#>Sue Barker made a surprise appearance</a> on Day 4 of Wimbledon as she returned to the BBC to interview Andy Murray.

A teary Sue told the crowds: "It's been an absolute privilege. I've loved it. 30 amazing years."&nbsp;</p><h2>England's quarter-final interrupts match</h2><p id=eg6_VTbyao data-wc=35>One of <a class=hm-link href=#>Novak Djokovic</a>'s matches was stopped as the crowd celebrated England reaching the semi-finals of Euro 2024. The England football team beat Switzerland on penalties following a 1-1 draw in Germany on 6 July.&nbsp;</p><p id=eh-OcJI6OcT data-wc=29>Back in the UK, as Novak was getting ready to serve against Australian tennis player Alexei Popyrin on Centre Court, the crowd erupted into cheers upon hearing England's victory.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=e4RUmOgWUD data-wc=46>Aware of the situation, the commentator said: "We are just going to have to take a pause for the moment."

"That's why you guys stayed," he joked. "Congrats to England. I tried to shoot a penalty, I'm left-footed but Alexei defended it well."&nbsp;</p><h2>Novak Djokovic irked by Wimbledon crowd</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e27fd62d37b3-gettyimages-2160611874.jpg><p id=e_aLb4Zb8T data-wc=53>Novak Djokovic is no stranger to receiving boos during his matches. However, after his game with Holger Rune in the final round of 16, the tennis champion criticised some members of the Wimbledon crowd at Centre Court for their "disrespectful" behaviour. He accused them of using Holger's name as "an excuse to boo".&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: The moment Novak Djokovic walks out of BBC interview</figure><p id=eiDuKJQBRx data-wc=62>Throughout the pair's fourth-round match on Monday, hundreds of fans greeted Holger's winners and Djokovic's errors with elongated cries of "Ruuuuuuune". When on-court interviewer Rishi Persad asked for his thoughts, Novak responded: "I know they were cheering for Rune, but that's an excuse to also boo. I have been on the tour for more than 20 years. I know all the tricks.&nbsp;</p><p id=egagtyoRaE data-wc=39>"There's some respectful people who paid for a ticket to come and watch tonight and they love tennis and appreciate the players." He then added: "I've played in much more hostile environments, trust me. You guys can't touch me."&nbsp;</p><h2>Longest women's semi-final</h2><p id=e1OhXjYUur data-wc=33>Italian player Jasmine Paolini had never won a match at the All England Club, but became a Wimbledon finalist after she ousted Donna Vekic in the longest women's semi-final in the tournament's history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/92ce385ca9fa-gettyimages-2161013942.jpg><p id=e7SMPaq7gy data-wc=21>Their game lasted an impressive two hours and 51 minutes on Centre Court. "This match, I will remember forever," said Jasmine.&nbsp;</p><h2>Nick Kyrgios as a commentator&nbsp;</h2><p id=erzdE9KMKW data-wc=49>Nick Kyrgios may not have been on the courts playing, but he has been in London sharing his thoughts as one of the main BBC commentators. He has joined tennis legend John McEnroe at this year's Championships, and it's safe to say that viewers have been loving his commentary.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/86285c585f81-gettyimages-2159825498.jpg><p id=e2hwnWcQn7 data-wc=44>"Nick Kyrgios drives me crazy when he's on a tennis court but I have LOVED him as a commentator at Wimbledon," wrote one fan on X.

I was feeling it during the match," the 2021 US Open champion said. "I think especially on serve, it was affecting me a bit."&nbsp;</p><p id=ejBXU2X4lU data-wc=58>She added: "It was a difficult match. I think Lulu played really good tennis. I gave my best, I fought really hard. Her tennis was better and she deserved the win." The defeat came a day after she pulled out of a planned mixed doubles appearance alongside Andy Murray, in which she cited "stiffness" in her right wrist.</p><h2>Princess Kate's confirmed appearance</h2><p id=e0F3v0YfCq data-wc=19><a class=hm-link href=#>The Princess of Wales</a> is due to make an appearance in SW19 on Sunday to watch the men's final.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bd0ed3b9b6a3-princess-kate-tennis-ball-dress.jpg><p id=eJbmSJDi9w6 data-wc=38>The outing comes amid her ongoing cancer treatment and just weeks after <a class=hm-link href=#>she attended Trooping the Colour,&nbsp;</a>making her appearance at the All England Lawn Tennis Club her second since news of her <a class=hm-link href=#>cancer diagnosis back in March.</a></p><p id=erx9Y_rlitl data-wc=18>Kate is a huge fan of the sport and is patron of the All England Lawn Tennis Club.</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">Tennis players and their famous exes</h3><h2>Grigor Dimitrov and Nicole Scherzinger</h2><p id=e9hcFkmv6Q>The tennis player started dating the Pussycat Dolls singer in late 2015 and confirmed the relationship a year later.
