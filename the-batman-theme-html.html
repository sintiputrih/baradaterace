By Erika Hanson | Updated 4 weeks ago Music plays a major role in developing themes and tones in film. With music shaping how we perceive the visual imagery on the big screen, a score can often make or break a movie. Great composers are tasked with setting the mood for films, and the nod at film’s melodic overtures can show just how much of an impact the score has on perception."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

With music shaping how we perceive the visual imagery on the big screen, a score can often make or break a movie. Great composers are tasked with setting the mood for films, and the nod at film’s melodic overtures can show just how much of an impact the score has on perception. With Matt Reeve’s ushering in a new era of The Batman with <a href=#>Robert Pattinson</a>, the filmmaker looks to the movie’s sound to broadcast the darker tone set to hit theatres this march. Taking to Twitter, the upcoming film’s director shared the film’s first track, The Batman theme, from award-winning Star Trek composer <a href=#>Michael Giacchino</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>And you can listen to the theme below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=0.92307692307692>https://www.<a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=youtube data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>youtube</a>.com/watch?v=Cwcinb2OxUo&list=PLBKadB95sF44svAf6GEN3TTFPJwFdwrmm&index=1</figure><p>Quite different from the infamous Batman theme coined in the ’60s, fans won’t have to worry about humming along to any “na na na’s” in the newest score. Matt Reeves shared a link to The Batman theme releasing the first track from the upcoming film’s score with the rest of the world. Revealing that the composer wrote the theme before the movie even began production, Reeves admitted to getting chills the first time he listened to the theme music. The 6-minute 47-second theme can be streamed on Apple Music, Spotify, iTunes Store, Deezer, and Tidal. As the theme starts off with an escalating classical Batman tone, the score transitions to an emotionally driven dark climax comprised of a combination of string, brass, and bass.</p><p>With an enduring history spanning over 80 years, the caped crusader’s theme music has been reimagined by plenty of established composers. From the infamous original theme created by <a href=#>Neal Hefti</a> in the ’60s, <a href=#>Danny Elfman</a>, Hans Zimmer, and James Newton Howard are just a few of the composers that have long given Gotham City its musical flavor. But this time around, the studio procured Michael Giacchino to reinvent The Batman theme. The 54-year-old composer boasts a long and successful resume that has earned him plenty of awards, including an Oscar, an Emmy, and three Grammys.&nbsp;</p><p>While Giacchino has been composing for film, tv, and <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title="video games" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>video games</a> since the early ’90s, his breakthrough success came around 2001, when J.J. Abrams commissioned the musician to create scores for his hit tv series Alias and Lost. Similarly, Giacchino has produced the scores for blockbuster hits like Mission Impossible, Jurrasic Park, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and the 2009 <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title="Star Trek" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Star Trek</a> reboot. Other than lending his ear for The Batman theme, Giacchino is also set to provide scores for this year’s release of Jurrasic World: Dominion and <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=Thor data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Thor</a>: Love and Thunder.</p><p>Giacchino and Matt Reeves have worked together multiple times, with the most recent pairing seen in War for the Planet of the Apes. As the two seemingly hit it off, Reeves has put his full trust in the composer. Giacchino recently made a <a href=#>comment</a> saying that he felt total freedom to do whatever he wanted due to Reeves’ support. With Reeves and Pattison ramping up for the impending release date of The Batman on March 4th, The Batman theme will surely enthuse the vigilante fans as the world prepares for another dark take on the world’s most famous superhero.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ismJp6o63TppinZaSdsq6xjaGrpqQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
