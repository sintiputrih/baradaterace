I knew I was playing good tennis, I mean Thanasi [was] as well,” Hurkacz declared after his win in Miami.</p><p>“I was just trying to stay in there and compete, play some good shots. Either way, if I won or I lost — obviously I wanted to win so, so much — but either way [I] should have been happy with myself.”</p><p>Hurkacz pulled off some remarkable shots during his win, including a devastating return on a well-struck slice serve into the body from Kokkinakis.</p><p>Explaining that audacious up the line winner, Hurkacz said that he was expecting Kokkinakis to go for something on his second serve.</p><p>“Just felt he was going to go for another one,” Hurkacz said.</p><p>He added that those ‘stolen points’ are what helped him come out on top in this clash.</p><p>Both players were dialled in on their service games with each belting more than 20 aces in the match and neither being broken more than once.</p><p>When Hurkacz faced his fifth match point and saved it with an ace the writing was on the wall.</p><p>After saving five match points, Hurkacz would close out the contest at his first opportunity with his staunch defence forcing an error out of the Australian.</p><p>Earlier in the day, Daniil Medvedev made quick work of Roberto Carballes Baena whom he dispatched 6-1, 6-2.</p><p>Medvedev decided to break out a few drop shots, learning from facing Carlos Alcaraz last week.</p><p>“After my match with Carlos I thought I needed to use that shot more,” Medvedev joked. “I’ve always liked drop shots but it’s not a weapon in my game that I’m going to use 50 times a match. You need to have confidence in the shot and today it worked pretty well.”</p><p>Sixth seed Felix Auger-Aliassime tread a path somewhere in between as he dug deep to scratch out a 7-6, 7-6 win over Brazil’s Thiago Monteiro.</p><p>The Canadian felt that he was the better player across the contest.</p><p>“After the first set, I felt a little bit better,” said Auger-Aliassime after his win. “I was giving myself chances… He came up with some good serves and great shots every time, so [I just had to] keep driving, keep trying, keep moving forward and keep staying positive. I think that was the key today, to just stay strong mentally.”</p><p>He missed some chances to close out the match in a more clinical fashion but he progresses nonetheless.</p><p>“I was serving pretty good,” said Auger-Aliassime.</p><p>“Unfortunately I couldn’t close it out at 6/4 [in the second-set tie-break] with a double fault but honestly, throughout the match, I felt good. Considering the conditions too. It was super windy, so to serve like this, on the big points, that was key today.”</p><p><strong>Round of 64 results</strong></p><p>Hubert Hurkacz (POL x8) bt Thanasi Kokkinakis (AUS) 6-7 (10/12), 7-6 (9/7), 7-6 (8/6)</p><p>Adrian Mannarino (FRA) bt Ben Shelton (USA x32) 6-4, 3-6, 6-1</p><p>Christopher Eubanks (USA) bt Borna Coric (CRO x17) 3-6, 6-4, 6-2</p><p>Grégoire Barrère (FRA) bt Cameron Norrie (GBR x11) 6-3, 6-2</p><p>Quentin Halys (FRA) bt Alex De Minaur (AUS x15) 6-7 (5/7), 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (10/8)</p><p>Mackenzie McDonald (USA) bt Matteo Berrettini (ITA x19) 7-6 (10/8), 7-6 (7/5)</p><p>Alex Molcan (SVK) bt Yoshihito Nishioka (JPN x28) 7-6 (7/5), 1-6, 6-2</p><p>Daniil Medvedev (RUS x4) bt Roberto Carballes Baena (ESP) 6-1, 6-2</p><p>Félix Auger-Aliassime (CAN x5) bt Thiago Monteiro (BRA) 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (10/8)</p><p>Francisco Cerundolo (ARG x25) bt Aleksandar Kovacevic (USA) 6-4, 6-4</p><p>Lorenzo Sonego (ITA) bt Daniel Evans (GBR x23) 4-6, 6-3, 6-2</p><p>Frances Tiafoe (USA x12) bt Yosuke Watanuki (JPN) 6-7 (5/7), 7-6 (7/3), 6-4</p><p>Karen Khachanov (RUS x14) bt Tomás Etcheverry (ARG) 6-1, 3-6, 6-3</p><p>Jirí Lehecka (CZE) bt Lorenzo Musetti (ITA x18) 6-4, 6-4</p><p>Christian Garín (CHI) bt Sebastián Báez (ARG x27) 7-6 (7/2), 6-3</p><p>Stefanos Tsitsipas (GRE x2) bt Richard Gasquet (FRA) walkover</p><p>READ MORE: <a href=#>Carlos Alcaraz off the mark in Miami as Jimmy Connors explains why he is head and shoulders above his peers</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHNp6Csa2Zqe6S7zGiYrahdqby2vo6hrJudoql6qcHRpJicsl2avaqvjJuYraycmnq1tMCnmKyhXaC8rLfIp5ikoaNiuqqtzKJkqKiVo3qzsdKuo62r</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
