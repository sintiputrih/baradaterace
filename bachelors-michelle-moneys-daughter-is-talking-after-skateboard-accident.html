Michelle Money’s daughter, Brielle, is awake and talking two weeks after a skateboarding accident landed her in the ICU with a head injury.
The Bachelor alum’s daughter, 15, has been moved to the neuroscience trauma unit at the hospital and according to an Instagram update from Money’s ex-husband, Ryan Money, on Monday, April 13, “her personality has not changed.”
Two days before Ryan’s social media update, the teenager was not talking, but now she’s back to her old ways, according to her father."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Pretty sure that we can confidently say that her personality has not changed. 48 hours ago we had not heard her talk….and now this. When FaceTiming Ashley and the kids, Ash asked her if I was entertaining her and she said, “He’s driving me crazy.” She also wants “coconut redbull”, “Diet Coke” and “Ben & Jerry’s ice&nbsp;cream” pretty bad. She currently has 3 favorite pastimes: giving the medical staff and myself a hard time, talking about what she wants to drink, or sleeping. As her father, I cannot tell you how happy this makes me. She also had her first food in over 2 weeks. She had some yogurt and some thickened Powerade. She is recognizing many people in the photos that are up in her room. To think back about all the questions we had about her and the extent of her injuries, this helps us know some important things. We are definitely&nbsp;not out of the woods yet on all of this, but to hear her talk, make symmetrical&nbsp;expressions, eat, and move all of her extremities&nbsp;in physical therapy is HUGE and literally nothing short of a miracle. Brielle’s progress in the last 24 hours is absolutely contributed to you prayers. I am SO GRATEFUL for you. I cry many times thinking about how grateful I am. Thank you!
