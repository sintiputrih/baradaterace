If you’ve been to these places at the year ending (around December to January), you would agree to the fact that these states are chilly just like most European countries on winter.

Harmattan can be defined as a very dusty and dry easterly wind, blowing the West African coast.

The harmattan season, from Twi word haramata, originates from the dry and dusty harmattan trade winds which blows from the Sahara desert over west Africa. In some parts of Nigeria, such as Lagos, this harmattan’s low temperature can hardly be felt due to its far location from the epicenter of the wind.</p><p>What happens during harmattan seasons is that it brings desert-like weather conditions: by lowering the humidity, dissipates cloud cover, prevents rainfall formation and sometimes creates big clouds of dust which can result in dust storms or sandstorms.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=top-10-coldest-states-in-nigeria-during-harmattan-season></span> Top 10 Coldest States in Nigeria During Harmattan Season<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Below are the top 10 coldest states in Nigeria that are mostly affected by the lower temperature of the harmattan season;</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=plateau-state></span> Plateau State<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Plateau state, precisely Jos plateau is the most coldest state and elevated land area in Nigeria. And for this reason, most part of the region is considerably cold. If you opportuned to visit Jos during the harmattan period, you will mistook the area for some European countries. This is due to the fact that the coldness of the weather here is much like the winter. Presently, the weather temperature of the area reads about 17°C. The coldness of Jos city, and the state on the whole, has made it a favourite holiday destination for both tourists and expatriates based in Nigeria.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=kano-state></span> Kano State<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kano is another cold Nigerian state in the northern part of Nigeria. Although, the state is typically very hot throughout the year but from December down through February, which is the harmattan season, the state is very cold with a low temperature. At Night-time, the temperature is cool during these few months with an average low temperature ranging from 11 to 15°C.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=sokoto-state></span> Sokoto State<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Sokoto is another state quite close the onset of the harmattan wind, and this results to the area being one of the most affected during the cold season.
