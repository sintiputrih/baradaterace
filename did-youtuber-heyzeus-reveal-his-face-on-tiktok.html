Others love social media but aren’t as open when sharing personal details, including how they look.</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>We know some YouTubers only by their voice, mannerisms in speech and laughter, and logos or sketches they’ve had drawn for them. One of those&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTubers</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>TDM_Heyzeus</strong>&nbsp;— but some fans wonder if we might know what he looks like after years of just hearing his voice.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-who-is-tdm-heyzeus data-injectable=false>Who is TDM_Heyzeus?</h2><p data-characters=227 data-current-count=227 data-injectable=false>A popular YouTuber who plays games, answers questions, and gives advice on everything from skins to weapons, TDM_Heyzeus has quite a following on the platform. With 318k subscribers, his videos reach a broad audience worldwide.</p><p data-characters=37 data-current-count=264 data-injectable=false>The bio for TDM_Heyzeus reads simply:</p><p>“Everything about CSGO skins – trade ups, cases, knives, inventories, stickers, patterns, drama and scandals – all with an annoying Australian Accent.”</p><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=212 data-injectable=false>Fans don’t quite agree with the “annoying Australian Accent” part, but that voice is why people think they might have seen his face in a video not related to his YouTube that appeared on <strong>TikTok</strong>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Was TDM_Heyzeus’ face revealed in a TikTok video?</h2><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false>Fans began sharing a clip of a TikTok video on social media asking if we’d just heard TDM_Heyzeus’ voice as he was stopped in the street to answer a couple of questions.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=693 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>We got em <a href=#>@TDM_Jesus</a> is is true? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/UzVRhlZmjx</a></p>— Brokita (@brokucs) <a href=#>August 19, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false>Viewers have taken to the video with excitement and a sense of hesitation. He didn’t show his face on YouTube, so if this is him, is it really worth rejoicing if it’s something he wasn’t ready for?</p><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>Several comments state that he knew the video would get posted online, leading to speculation from longtime fans. Others note that the video has 1 million views already, so it’s not a well-kept secret anymore.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I mean he knew that this would get posted on the internet.</p>— ronics (@ActuallyRonics) <a href=#>August 20, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=194 data-current-count=494 data-injectable=true>While he did reveal his earnings and that he is a YouTuber, he didn’t give out his channel name, and some fans note that it’s proof the “reveal” wasn’t intentional.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>The fact he said rather not say to what his youtube channel is kind if indicative that it wasn't intentional</p>— kieron (@Kierxnnnn_) <a href=#>August 21, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>While he hasn’t posted an official video noting that fans have finally seen what he looks like, a comment on Twitter says he did acknowledge it in a stream.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>hes confirmed it on stream 1000 times, also if u write !tiktok in the chat, a bot replies saying "yes its me in the tiktok"</p>— Zewez (@Zewez2) <a href=#>August 24, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=153 data-current-count=453 data-injectable=true>If it is indeed him, fans are enjoying the video, noting that he’s quite handsome.

It looks like fans might need to be patient in waiting for his official yes or no to come. For now, he’s continuing his social media content the way he always has and giving gamers a look into hackers, trading, and skins.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeppMK1wcGeZp2hlGLGsMHTrpmeql2dsrrGxK6qZqqVq7KiuIyhoKxllpawpnnOp2StoZupvKx7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
