I think that if you can achieve that, you’ve got the audience, and they won’t have forgotten about your movie by the time they’ve left the theater and headed out for dinner. If you can make the audience recognize themselves in the characters in some way, that’s a big part of it. I don’t think there’s a formula. I’m not an intellectual by any standards, so I guess my instincts are fairly good.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to learn more about the&nbsp;<i>Deep Water&nbsp;</i>novel:<span class=s2><br></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BlrrW%2ByJygmmWYnrSpv8yiq6GrXZmypryMsJitnaJifnqBj6xkp6emmrlusdWeqbKsmJ67qHnTqGSkpp%2BsfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
