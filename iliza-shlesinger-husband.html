"We went out to dinner, and I remember starting to unbutton my pants as I came in the door because I had to pee," Iliza said.</p><p>"I realized our living room was full of flowers and candles, and Noah stopped me before I left the room, saying there was something he wanted to do before I ran off to the bathroom. I started crying and turned away, yelling that it couldn’t happen with my fly down!" She reassured the Brides journalist she was able to zip up her pants and turn around to see Noah proposing.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by ɪʟɪᴢᴀ (@ilizas)</a></p></figure><p>For their wedding, Noah's friend and co-author of the cookbook On Vegetables, Jeremy Fox, curated the menu. While Iliza is known for her skills on stage, her husband Noah is the host of Don't Panic Pantry, a Facebook Watch series about cooking in quarantine. His Instagram is filled with drool-worthy dishes and recipes that are enough to make anyone say "yes!" to a proposal.</p><p>Noah's next cookbook is expected to arrive in 2022.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Iliza Shlesinger pregnant? And if so, what is her due date?</h2><p>During one of her comedy shows on Aug. 13, 2021, Iliza announced her pregnancy news to the audience and said her "big project" would be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">due in January 2022</a>. She confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> that the couple are expecting a girl.</p><p>In an Instagram post on Aug. 21, 2021, Iliza shared some mirror selfies featuring her and her husband; in one of them, where she's turned to the side, her baby bump is visible. The caption — a single heart emoji — is enough to capture the enthusiasm of the first-time parents-to-be. Fans flooded the comments with their congratulations, heart emojis, and more.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by ɪʟɪᴢᴀ (@ilizas)</a></p></figure><p>Iliza recently made an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! with guest host RuPaul, and she proudly documented the occasion with another glowing photograph on Instagram.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by ɪʟɪᴢᴀ (@ilizas)</a></p></figure><p>The post from Aug. 25, 2021, tags Iliza's makeup artist, hair stylist, and clothes stylist, and beneath all three, leaves a little baby emoji and tags her husband.
