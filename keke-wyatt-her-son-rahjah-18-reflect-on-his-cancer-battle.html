I was literally dying, and we didn’t know.”</p><p>After Rahjah went to the hospital for bloodwork, he was rushed back over concerning results. “I said, ‘What is it? Like, cancer or something?’ ” Wyatt recalled of her initial phone call with his doctor. “And she said, ‘Yes.’ Honey, my butthole fell on the floor. My throat hit my butt and my butt hit the floor. I couldn’t believe it. I said, ‘What kind of cancer?’ And when she said leukemia, honey, my teeth literally started chattering.”</p><p>The Indiana native also reflected on the multiple seizures Rahjah suffered while in the hospital. “Man, that’s crazy. Whenever something happens with you, the whole hospital pops up at your door,” the singer told him. “Everybody had something to do on you. That was the scariest crap I had ever been through in my life. If there was ever a time in my life where I would lose my mind, that would be the day.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Keke-Wyatt-Son-Rahjah-Cancer-Free-After-Leukemia-Diagnosis-3.jpg><p>The<a href=#> Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars</a> alum first said that Rahjah was “cancer-free” in November 2018 while telling TMZ that her ex-husband <strong>Michael Ford</strong> wanted a divorce because she was an “emotional wreck” amid his treatment.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Wyatt explained at the time: “He says that from the very beginning, ‘You never trusted me,’ and all that kind of stuff.
