There has been speculation about what happened, but the family has not confirmed anything.</p><p>In part, the Southern Charm star wrote, “Not enough words can encapsulate who Worth was and the impact he left behind. June 8th, 2023 The Lord called you home. We are going to miss your goofiness, your bear hugs, and that infectious laugh.”</p><p>She went on to talk about his love for his family, his girlfriend, and Jesus Christ.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-ann-green-has-a-tough-time-on-southern-charm>Taylor Ann Green has a tough time on Southern Charm</h2><p>It’s been a tough year for Taylor Ann Green on Southern Charm. She came off the Season 8 reunion very upset at Shep Rose for their relationship ending.</p><p>Season 9 opened up similarly, and through it all, Taylor got mixed up with Austen Kroll, which only complicated things further.</p><p>And in the most recent episode, Olivia Flowers and Taylor had words over the Austen situation. They ended up with the boys at Shep Rose’s family home, where things took a turn.</p><p>Taylor egged Shep on, which caused him to lash out at her, revealing he thinks <a href=#>cheating on her was sometimes “fun.”</a></p><p>She has moved on with someone new, but wounds will be reopened when the Southern Charm Season 9 reunion films. It was teased during BravoCon, and with Southern Hospitality Season 2 starting next month, the reunion should be shot in the coming days.</p><p>Worth’s passing will likely be discussed at the reunion, as it will also be likely that the passing of Olivia Flowers’ brother, Conner, will also be discussed.</p><p>Southern Charm airs Thursdays at 9/8c on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ6ekv7W0jKCpnp2eYrCiwdKeZKieXZmyosDHZp%2Bor12ZtqV50qisraCVp7tur8eaqaZlo6mus3nTmrClp6Jirq%2B6jKCpnp2eqHqjvs6tn56qXZm2pns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
