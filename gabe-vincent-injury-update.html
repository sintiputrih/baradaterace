However, Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spoke</a> out on the day of Game 5 to confirm that the guard was not healthy enough to play.</p><p>“He went through his routine and workout this morning, just wanted to get ahead of it," Erik said on May 25. "He is feeling better, but just not good enough to play an Eastern Conference Finals game."</p><p>Since Gabe’s injury, none of his teammates have commented. However, Erik confirmed that everything Gabe has done to try and get back into playing in the finals is why his teammates “respect him so much.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, what is Gabe Vincent’s injury update?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@iamgabevincent2</a></figure><p>According to the ESPN Miami Heat <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">injury roster</a>, Gabe is still injured, but his status is day-to-day, meaning he is not completely out of the finals.
