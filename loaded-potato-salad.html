I have made a lot of potato salads in my day and I have to say this one takes the cake! This Loaded Potato Salad with Crispy Bacon is the best potato salad!&nbsp;</p><p>What makes this bacon potato salad super special is the combination of crispy bacon, freshly grated cheddar cheese, and fresh green onions to give it freshness. Then the combination of both sour cream and mayonnaise gives it that extra creaminess.

I suggest using Yukon Gold potatoes for their creaminess. They may be referred to as gold or yellow potatoes. A similar potato may be called Klondike Goldust potatoes.&nbsp;</p><h3>More Popular Potato Salad Recipes:</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/The-Best-Loaded-Potato-Salad-Recipe-2-scaled.jpg alt="The Best Loaded Potato Salad Recipe is made with creamy gold potatoes, crispy bacon, cheddar cheese, green onions, sour cream, mayonnaise, seasoned salt, and pepper.

Russet potatoes are too dry for this potato salad. You can leave the skin on the potatoes or peel them.</span> <span>Seasoned Salt can also be called Lawry's seasoned salt. It gives a zestier flavor. You may substitute regular salt if you don't have seasoned salt.&nbsp;</span> <span>I suggest using a block of sharp cheddar cheese and grating it right before adding it to the potato salad. It is much creamier than the pre-packaged shredded cheese.</span> <span>Salt the water when cooking the potatoes to infuse some flavor. Check for seasonings and add more salt and pepper to the potato salad, if needed.</span><p class=has-small-font-size>Nutrition information is automatically calculated, so should only be used as an approximation.</p><span class=cp-load-after-post></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvDnqmnoJ%2Bjsrp6wqikaKSflrGmsIyppq2ZpKR6tK3Lmpto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
