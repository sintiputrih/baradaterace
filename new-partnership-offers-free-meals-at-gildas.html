Many people impacted by cancer lack access to nutritious meals, according to a Thursday Gilda’s Club release.</p><p>The new partnership, driven by the dedication of Angerer Eats and their clientele, raised $3,645 in just 48 hours back in November, emphasizing the overwhelming community support for this significant cause.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/02/AngererEatsXGildas.jpg><p>Kelsey Allen, program director at Gilda’s Club Quad Cities, is grateful for Angerer Eats, in raising funds to install a freezer at the Davenport Clubhouse, 1351 W. Central Park Ave., Suite 200.</p><p>This freezer will be stocked with wholesome, home-cooked meals, thanks to the commitment of Mary Angerer, the owner of Angerer Eats (based at 806 40th Ave., Bettendorf).</p><p>“We are extremely grateful for Angerer Eats and their amazing followers for raising the funds to put a freezer in our Davenport Clubhouse and for Mary’s commitment to keep it stocked,” Allen said. “This resource will be valuable to the many individuals/families that we serve to those being impacted by cancer.</p><p>“To be able to stop by our Clubhouse and pick out a family-style meal on a day you are feeling crummy from treatment, caregiving, etc., will be a relief to so man,” she said. “We are thrilled to be able to offer this new resource moving into 2024.”</p><p>“I knew the minute I walked into Gilda’s Club and toured their facilities I needed to join forces and help so many families that go through there,” Mary Angerer said in the release. “We started by helping with one month of weekly meals that they offer to their patients and families, realizing quickly that more could be offered.”</p><p>“I thought what if I made it accessible for patients any time of day?” she added. “That’s when we thought of a freezer, where all my extra meals could be brought over weekly and could be a grab-and-go service. Families can grab and take home after a long day of treatment, or there is a full-service kitchen where meals could be heated on the spot.”</p><p>Angerer emphasized the core values of Angerer Eats, stating, “Angerer Eats is about serving those in our community with healthy, home-cooked convenient meals that are heat and eat. I want Angerer Eats to also be about giving and helping those going through hardships at any stage in life. Gilda’s Club is giving me that opportunity.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/02/Angerer2.png><p>The public can help further support this initiative and support simply by visiting <a href=#>angerereats.com</a> to donate a meal.</p><p>Anyone impacted by cancer is eligible to stop in with the purpose of feeding those affected by cancer who may be facing food insecurities. Eligible people can stop in during Gilda’s Club normal business hours on weekdays to choose a meal that best suits their needs. At this time, they ask each person takes one meal per visit unless otherwise needed.</p><p>To celebrate the collaborative efforts, they have launched a T-shirt fundraiser to celebrate the arrival of the freezer. Proceeds from the shirt fundraiser will contribute to sustaining the no-cost services provided by Gilda’s Club.</p><p>Shirts can be purchased until Feb. 25th at midnight <a href=#>HERE</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaKWer12lrrPAzZ6prKCZpXqwssWeqaxllqeypnnMnpilq12WwW6zyKWbmqtf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
