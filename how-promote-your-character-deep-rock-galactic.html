There are four classes to choose from at the start of the game — Engineer, Gunner, Driller, and Scout — and each can be leveled up by conducting missions in the game.</p><p>Once your character reaches level 25, you’ll be on your way to earning a promotion. Before your dwarf can earn his stripes, however, you’ll need to complete a specific assignment to prove you’re worthy of a promotion. Each class has a different assignment, and each assignment contains four unique missions. You can find these new assignments on the Assignment Board in the Space Rig section of the game.</p><p data-injection=true>You must complete these objectives in order to unlock the “promote” option in the Character Select section. Each class assignment begins and ends with Mining Expedition and Point Extraction missions respectively, but the two in the middle will differ depending on your class.</p><p>Once these missions and assignments are completed, you can promote your character. Head to the Character Select screen. You should see a “promote” button you can click. Bear in mind that you’ll need a large number of credits and crafting materials to achieve a promotion. Ensure you have enough resources to rank up before you click the button.</p><p>The promotion resets your character to level one, but don’t worry. You keep your weapons and upgrades, and the reset just allows you to start leveling up in this new rank. You’ll also earn an extra perk slot upon being promoted, and an honor badge to frame your character portrait.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6e0d0e60d322d33cdac389f145939f8b?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Tom Power</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc></p><h4><a href=#>More Stories by Tom Power</a></h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qK3Mnqeuql6YvK57xq6gnZ2jZLWww4ypqailn6mybsXOrqlmm5iWv6Kv056pZpyVmr1uvs6comafkaGupMDInA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
