Aristide was born on 15th July 1953 in Port-Salut, Sud Department, Haiti. He is best known for being the first democratically elected president of Haiti. Despite facing several coup d’etats, he held the presidential position multiple times, contributing to the accumulation of his wealth.</p><p>Jean Bertrand Aristide initially pursued a career in the church before entering politics. His involvement in the establishment of social policies and various reforms significantly influenced his net worth.</p><p>Aristide began his education in a school associated with the Salesian order before later pursuing studies at College Notre-Dame and the Grand Seminaire Notre Dame. He also studied psychology at the State University of Hawaii before being officially ordained as a Salesian priest in 1982. His efforts opposing dictatorship and advocating for the rights of the oppressed led to multiple attempts on his life. Consequently, the church removed him from the Salesian order due to his political involvement.</p><p>In 1990, Aristide announced his presidential candidacy and won in what was considered the first honest election in Haitian history. However, only eight months after his election, he was overthrown in a violent military coup. Subsequently, he spent time in exile, with the possible involvement of the United States in the coup sparking several controversies.</p><p>After receiving support for his return to Haiti, Aristide was re-elected as president in 2001. However, another coup forced him to leave the country once again. Following years of exile, he returned to Haiti in 2011 but has since refrained from active involvement in politics.</p><p>In 1996, Aristide married Mildred Trouillot, with whom he has two daughters. Apart from politics, he has also released several publications over the years.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmihnpmeYq%2BmvtOrmKecXZa%2Fqr%2FTopueZZ6awW7DzquroWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
