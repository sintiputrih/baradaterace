After years of yo-yo dieting, Lauren Manzo‘s battle of the bulge became a major plot point on the current season of Real Housewives of New Jersey — and she suffered cruel comments at the hands of anonymous Twitter followers.
“I hated myself,” the 24-year-old, 5-foot-3 owner of makeup store Cafface tells Us Weekly exclusively. “I was depressed.” At her heaviest, she weighed 185 pounds.
So, last September, Manzo finally followed the advice of concerned parents Caroline and Albert and underwent lap band surgery — in which a silicone band is placed around the top part of the stomach to control food consumption."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The Bravo star (who’s been dating Vita Scalia for three years) hopes to lose 35 more pounds.</p><p>Showing off her incredible new shape to <strong>Us</strong>, Manzo says she feels “amazing. Getting the lap band was the best thing I’ve done in my life.”</p><p>She admits to <strong>Us</strong> that she initially kept the lap band surgery secret. “So many fans related to my struggle,” she says. “I didn’t want to feel like I was letting them down.”</p><p>She cautions of the device: “It’s not a miracle button that lets you eat whatever you want . . . I wanted to try to lose weight on my own for a while.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>And, indeed, although Manzo avoids salt, sugar, carbs and fat with her new diet regime — and endures intense sessions with trainer Guy Del Corso — she still loves to eat.</p><p>“I like food,” she explains. “I can’t drink liquid egg whites for the rest of my life. So I’ve learned a lot of great ways to cook now . . . I have great willpower.”</p><p>Her ultimate goal? “Hopefully, by the end of the summer, I’ll be in a bikini. I’ve never worn a bikini in my life!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGarnZGheqm71KycsKGmmsBuu8VmpZ6vXZ%2Bys7%2FEsqpmpJGqv6a6jKaYp7KfYrmwv9NmamlloKTCr7DSZmlpaWJnfXd7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
