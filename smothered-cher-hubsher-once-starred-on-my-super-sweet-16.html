Although she still dabbles in reality TV from time to time, she mainly works as a registered nurse and dating coach.</p><p>“I started out as a psychiatric registered nurse, and I worked for four years [doing that] in Florida,” she told the New York Post. “And I saw how a lot of depression and anxiety stems from poor relationship habits. So when I moved to New York City I got life coaching certified and I opened up my own date coaching business called NYC Wing Woman, and I help men and women learn how to navigate the dating scene in New York. It’s a very amazing and rewarding experience.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTqKycoKeasqy42GeaqKVfpby0wNJoqqanpJ2ys7HDZpqhnaJitbau0qGcq2Wfo7CmedKtmKuqlZl6sLqMprBmq6WlsrN50rCcnqxdZoNw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
