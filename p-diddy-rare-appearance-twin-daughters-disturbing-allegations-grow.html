Upon noticing the presence of paparazzi, the rapper offered a peace sign gesture.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the outing, Diddy donned a black and purple velour sweatsuit paired with Nike sneakers and sunglasses. His daughters sported matching attire consisting of black leggings, white sports bras, black zip-up sweatshirts, oversized black shades, and coordinating black and white Nike Air Jordans.</p><p>Though Diddy and his girls seemed unbothered during the outing, the rapper didn’t have any comment on the ongoing investigation, which is coupled by several civil lawsuits that allege him of sex trafficking, sexual abuse, and rape.</p><h2 id=diddy-is-being-sued-but-isn-rsquo-t-facing-criminal-charges-yet>Diddy Is Being Sued But Isn’t Facing Criminal Charges Yet</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/this-is-what-its-really-like-to-work-for-p-diddy-according-to-employees.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since his properties were raised on March 25 (Diddy was apparently on route to the airport with his daughters to visit the Bahamas when he was stopped by authorities), Combs has vehemently <a href=#>refuted all accusations leveled against him</a>. His legal representatives have dismissed the lawsuits and their claims as mere attempts to extract money, labeling them as either "baseless" or "sickening."</p><p>It's worth noting that despite the allegations, the entertainer has not faced any formal charges or accusations from federal prosecutors regarding any criminal activity, though they could be forthcoming.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/this-is-what-its-really-like-to-work-for-p-diddy-according-to-employees.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Inside Diddy's Shocking Allegations Following His Historic House Raids</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>There's a disturbing reason why P. Diddy's Miami and Los Angeles homes were raided in March 2024.</span><p>The latest legal cases surfaced several months following a lawsuit filed against Diddy by his former partner, singer Cassie, in November. The pop star accused him of assaulting her in 2018, including allegations of rape, physical abuse, coercing her to carry a firearm to intimidate her, among many disturbing claims. Notably, <a href=#>Cassie’s lawsuit against Combs was swiftly settled</a> just a day after its filing, with the terms of the settlement remaining undisclosed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the recent accusations are part of a broader pattern of legal challenges against Combs that span back to the 1990s, coinciding with the inception of his record label, Bad Boy Records.</p><p>Puff Daddy, also known as P. Diddy or Sean Combs, carved an iconic career in the music industry as a rapper, producer, and entrepreneur. Rising to prominence in the 1990s, he founded Bad Boy Records, a label credited with launching the careers of several prominent artists. Combs is known his hit singles like "I'll Be Missing You" and "Mo Money Mo Problems." Over the years, he has diversified his ventures, including fashion, acting, and liquor branding.</p><p>While he’s faced various accusations and lawsuits over the years, the mounting lawsuits against him may represent a turn in his career and tarnish his reputation. The cases remain ongoing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinZpyZmbG6edGaqZ5lkaW9pq3RmqWcnV2pxKq6jJ2Yrp%2BYqbKzv4ydoKyspaevqrrGZpilpJWcrrW1zqeqZp%2BipMRw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
