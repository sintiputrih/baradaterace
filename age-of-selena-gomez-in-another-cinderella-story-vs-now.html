Even though the premise of the original “<strong>A Cinderella Story</strong>” was based on a centuries-old cliche, the writing and performance nonetheless seemed contemporary.</p><p>Unfortunately, “Another Cinderella Story” was unable to achieve the same success. The narrative of “<strong>A Cinderella Story</strong>” follows two regular high school seniors as they completed college applications and engaged in normal senior-year activities.</p><p>The protagonists of “Another Cinderella Story” were a skilled but stage-shy high school dancer and a famous pop singer who opted to finish high school as a “regular child.”</p><h2>The Age Gap in Another Cinderella Story!</h2><p>The big difference in age between the main actors seemed to be the most controversial thing about “Another Cinderella Story.” When the movie was being made, Selena was only 15 years old, while Drew Seeley was 26.</p><p>One film critic said, “It’s too bad that their age isn’t taken into account more.” Hollywood is known for pairing older men with younger women in romantic roles, but Selena wasn’t even old enough to drive a car.
