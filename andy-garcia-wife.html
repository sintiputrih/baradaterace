He's been married for years.</h2><p>You'd be hard-pressed to find a celebrity who's been married for as long as Andy Garcia. Reportedly, he has been married to a woman named Marivi Lorido since 1982. To put that in perspective, Andy's first acting credit was in 1983 in the film Blue Skies Again.</p><p>That means he's been married longer than he's been in show business! His big break wasn't even until 1987 in The Untouchables. His marriage predates his rise to stardom by several years.</p><p>According to a 1997 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Chicago Tribune</a>, Andy knew Marivi for over a decade before they got married. "It was love at first sight," he told the Tribune. "I always knew I would marry her."</p><p>When convincing her to travel to Hollywood with him to pursue his acting career, he even stated, "She was easy to persuade, but her father wasn't."</p><p>That's a full-circle moment, considering his current role in Father of the Bride.</p><p>Andy even went so far as to propose to Marivi on their first date, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CelebSuburb</a> reports. They remained engaged for several years until officially tying the knot in 1982.</p><p>As for Marivi herself, she's no stranger to show business. She's a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">film producer</a>, having worked on movies like Just the Ticket in 1998. She and Andy also own their own production company called CineSon Entertainment. Truly, this Hollywood couple represents relationship goals for the rest of us.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Andy Garcia (@andygarcia)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Their family consists of four children, including one actor.</h2><p>Andy and Marivi have four children together.
