His slurred speech had viewers wondering whether he had relapsed into drugs, a problem he has been known to have in the past. Fortunately, that theory was squashed, as it was revealed he had an emergency dental surgery just before the big reunion.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Everything Fans Are Saying About Matthew Perry Since The Friends Reunion</a></span></p><p>Then, on May 28th, Perry garnered the attention of his fans once again when he posted a photo on Instagram with a younger woman.</p><p>Instagram users, unaware of the woman's identity, started to question Perry.</p><p>One user, doms.noms, commented: "Please someone tell me this is his daughter not girlfriend...I would love to believe he's not a creep."&nbsp;Several other users made similar comments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Cole Sprouse Admits To Crushing On Jennifer Aniston When He Played Ben On Friends</a></span></p><p>However, if those asking the questions had done any sleuthing, they would have quickly learned that neither was the case; Perry tagged the woman in the photo, and her name is Bianca Brancato. If you go to her Instagram page, you can see that she also posted a similar photo to her page referring to Perry as her boss.</p><p>Brancato's LinkedIn page further identifies her as the Executive Personal Assistant to Matthew Perry since 2015. She lists her duties as managing "all aspects of Matthew Perry's day to day schedule." That clears up the mystery!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the photo posted to his page, Perry and his assistant are sporting pieces from his <a href=#>clothing line</a>. The sweater he wore for the photo featured the line "Could I Be More Me?" This is a play on words references Perry's role as Chandler Bing on 'Friends.' In the hit show, Chandler Bing often over-emphasized the word "be" in sentences, and the other characters often poked fun at him for doing so.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here’s Why The Cast Of ‘Friends’ Had A Firm Pact Not To Date One Another</a></span></p><p>His assistant wore another one of the pieces, which read, "Could I Have Had a Longer Day?" This references the episode "The One with All the Kissing," in which Joey catches Chandler having a bubble bath with candles and some bubbly, and Chandler explains that he's had a "very long, hard day." (In reality, he was having a secret, romantic night with Monica.)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perry's clothing line also features clothing with the definition of "sarcasm" and a shirt which reads, "Could I Be Any More Vaccinated?" The merchandise is only available for three weeks, until mid June. The timing could not be any better, as Friends frenzy is taking over.</p><p>The 'Friends' reunion, which was hosted by James Corden, brought in a surge of viewers to HBO Max. It featured guest stars such as <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a>, Cara Delevigne and Cindy Crawford.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>‘Friends’ Reunion: Matt LeBlanc Takes Unexpected Side In Ross And Rachel Break Drama</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidq6GVo7G0ecWapaxlk6S7p8HSnptmmaNiwamx2GaroaGeoHqurdOtn56vXaWys77YrGSaq6OewLWtza1koqtdnba0ecOarKCgpJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
