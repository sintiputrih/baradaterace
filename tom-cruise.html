He ditched the idea in high school, and focused on becoming an actor. He made his first debut in Endless Love, and quickly shot to stardom. Within five years, Tom became the highest grossing actor in the market, starring in hits like Top Gun, Risky Business, and Rain Man. Tom became a big supporter of The Church Of Scientology in 1990, claiming that the teachings cured him of the dyslexia that he’d had all of his life. In the 1990s and 2000s, he continued to succeed, earning an average of 15 million dollars per picture, with movies such as the Mission Impossible franchise, Vanilla Sky, War of the Worlds, and Jerry Maguire. His role as Les Grossman in Tropic Thunder brought him even more popularity, helping him recover from controversy surrounding a few instances of bizarre public behavior, which many said were caused by his connection to Scientology. He’s been nominated for three Academy Awards and won three Golden Globe Awards. His net worth is estimated to be around $250 million.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><span class=celeb_profile_label>Best Known For:</span><br>His starring roles in blockbuster hits, including Mission Impossible and Top Gun, being a devout practitioner of Scientology, and jumping on Oprah’s couch, declaring his love for Katie Holmes.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><span class=celeb_profile_label>Personal Life:</span><br>Tom has been married three times.
