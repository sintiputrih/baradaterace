French Montana is currently dating <strong>Khloe Kardashian</strong>, and based on rumors that the <strong>Kris Kardashian </strong>doesn’t approve of the relationship, this revelation will ruffle her feathers even more.</p><p>On the <a title="Matty In The Morning" href=#>Matty in the Morning Show</a>, hosted by <strong>Matt Siegel</strong>, Sanchez described her June 20th encounter at the Centro Nightclub in Lawrence, Massachusetts. She claims that she was determined to get an interview with French Montana, and via a friend who is the club photographer she was eventually granted access to French Montana in the VIP area.</p><p>In the VIP area, Montana was surrounded by a bevy of women. Sanchez asked Montana for an interview and his response was that he would need to interview her first.&nbsp; Montana had the VIP area cleared so the two of them would be alone, and took Sanchez’s cell phone from her. They chit chatted for a while, but Montana then said that they’d need to go back to his tour bus if she wanted an interview, and that they’d go back to his hotel lobby where she could interview him.</p><p>Sanchez agreed to go back to the tour bus with the hope to score her first major interview as someone trying to break into the industry as a music journalist. Once in the tour bus it became obvious that Montana had no intention of giving an interview and that his motives were quite clear.</p><p>Sanchez resisted his advances, saying that it was not how she wanted to break into the industry and that she had morals. That’s when Montana said that she should be with him instead of one of those broke guys from her hometown of Lawrence. He said he’d fly her down to New York and even admitted that he was still with Khloe Kardashian.</p><p>Click below to hear the interview…</p><p>(Photo by Alberto E.
