Probably, like, six. It's crazy. It's very country. When I listen to it now, I'm like, 'Wow, I totally didn't realize how country this was.'

And of course he's nice to you. If you're in this room, you have something he needs," Swift said.</p><p>"The fact is that private equity is what enabled this man to think, according to his own social media posts, that he could 'buy me,'" Swift said. "But I'm obviously not going willingly," she said.</p><p>She went on to add, "Yet the most amazing thing to discover was that it would be the women in this industry who would have my back, and show me the most vocal support at one of the most difficult times.
