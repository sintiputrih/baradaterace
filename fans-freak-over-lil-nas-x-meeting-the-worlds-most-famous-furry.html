Like seriously, Sonicfox is a legend in the esports world. They also happen to be “Black. Nonbinary. Furry. Queer.” according to their Twitter bio.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=572 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’m a nonbinary gamer that just happens to be really godlike at fighting games and very outspoked about my beliefs. I live by empathy, understanding, and sticking true to myself! See me in Skullgirls 😤<a href=#>#UnderneathTheFursona</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/hN0AoF00v8</a></p>— SonicFox @ San Francisco (@SonicFox) <a href=#>June 6, 2020</a></figure><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=218 data-injectable=false>For the uninitiated, Furries are people who create an animal character for themselves that they identify with strongly. They wear elaborate costumes with ears and tails, and people from all over the world participate.</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>Lil Nas X has also made no secret of his love of video games, recently releasing a song called “STAR WALKIN’,” the official League of Legends Worlds anthem. It was maybe inevitable that these two superstars would cross paths one day. And cross paths they did.</p><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=187 data-injectable=false>Last night, SonicFox and Nix on Ice posted a photo of themselves getting ready to see the famous singer. “Just two non binary cuties going to see Lil Nas X,” the caption said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Just two non binary cuties going to see lil Nas x <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/RdwpyecoZ0</a></p>— Nix on Ice !!! ❄️ (@nixmixcosplay) <a href=#>October 24, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=253 data-current-count=253 data-injectable=false>Then something pretty cool happened during the concert. Lil Nas X recognized Sonic and called out to them from the stage. Someone actually captured the moment it happened. It’s an adorable off-the-cuff moment where Nas X seems genuinely surprised.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=553 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@SonicFox</a> Getting recognized by <a href=#>@LilNasX</a> on stage.

But that was not it. The singer then invited SonicFox onstage, which people also graciously captured.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@SonicFox</a> <a href=#>@LilNasX</a> God bless our troops 🫡💜 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Mq3h2FVzUw</a></p>— Sabray (@serketron) <a href=#>October 24, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=42 data-current-count=42 data-injectable=false>And it wasn’t just SonicFox, either.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>last night was one of the coolest experiences of my entire life. thank you so much <a href=#>@LilNasX</a> for celebrating furries and making us feel so special. plus i got to bounce around with the raddest furry ever <a href=#>@SonicFox</a> they’re so nice and fun!! best birthday ever <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/UCjGrT19iG</a></p>— Hashtag ACAB BLM (@HashtagPurr) <a href=#>October 24, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true>It’s hard to describe just how much of a pioneer Lil Nas X has been and continues to be for much-maligned groups, including furries. There has never been a pop star with so much pull paying so much attention to ancillary groups.</p><p data-characters=150 data-current-count=150 data-injectable=false>The move also incited some discussion within the furry lifestyle as to whether the attention from the singer is good or bad.
