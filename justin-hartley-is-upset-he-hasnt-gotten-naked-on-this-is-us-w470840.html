Asked to share his feelings about costar Milo Ventimiglia showing off his bare butt for a recent scene, 40-year-old Hartley — who occasionally goes shirtless as hunky actor Kevin Pearson on the hit drama — cheekily replied, “I’m a little upset about it."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I mean, what does that say? Am I losing it?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/justin-hartley-b06c54c9-d1ca-49c5-807a-b09b94ae0949.jpg><p>Despite his bruised ego, Hartley applauded Ventimiglia’s decision to flaunt his derriere. “I just leave that to him. He does that. He’s very good at that. … He’s such a good sport, though,” he said. “He’s a tremendous actor and a very talented guy and a very sweet guy, but also a very, very good sport and just an awesome human being.”</p><p>While he’s totally down to go nude for the show, Hartley said that there is one family member of his who hopes the day never comes. “My mom’s holding her breath,” he added with a laugh. “She’s like, ‘Please, God, no.’”</p><p>Just weeks before his interview on <i>The Talk</i>, the <i>Young and the Restless</i> alum — who shares daughter Isabella, 12, with ex-wife Lindsay Hartley — sat down with <i>Us Weekly </i>Video to share more behind-the-scenes secrets of <i>This Is Us</i>.</p><span class=caption></span><p>When it comes to the cast member who is most likely to cry during a table read, Hartley told <i>Us</i> that <b>Mandy Moore </b>gets rather emotional while going through the sob-inducing scripts. “She feels everything,” he said of the singer-actress, 32. “She’s very kind and, like, the warmest woman you’ll ever be around in your life. She’s very cool.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><i>This Is Us</i> airs on NBC Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGuq6Seu260wKurpZ2pYra0edSpqp6sXZ2ybrTArKWtZZekwbWxzWalmqOVmXqwuoytn6KrXZ7AbsHSZq5tb2BtgXF7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
