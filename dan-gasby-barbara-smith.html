The wrinkled skin, however, has not overpowered his persona. To complete the physical outlook, brown eyes, along with white hair, plays the lead role. Anything on the shoe and dress size will be updated soon.</p><h2>Early Life and Education</h2><p>Dan was born in New York and spent his childhood there with the family and siblings. His early life was pretty decent, with most of the needs being fulfilled with ease. His father was a field-house manager at the Steven Institute of Technology, while the mother is the home-maker.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Igk3jSY9VU</p><p>Looking at the father’s dedication, the urge to contribute to the field of business came to him. In the case of educational background, though, Gasby attended Colgate University. He was a pretty decent student in educational days.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Dan might be one of the sorted out businessmen now, but things were not the same always. His career started at UHF TV station in Tennessee.</p><p>Moving along the journey, Gasby became the vice-president of marketing at Camelot Entertainment Sales Inc. The achievements have moved in and out of the circuit with time.</p><p>Adding the sparks to his business career surely is the executive producer of Essence Awards and also the credit of being the creator for Big Break, which is a talent show.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daymond John Net Worth, Age, Height, FUBU, Wife, Instagram >></a></h4><p>Working in his life, Dan found out a lady who was also his business part cum wife. Both of them started a show named B. Smith with Style. Gasby’s wife is a restaurant herself.</p><p>Along with it, Dan has always supported in all of the business performed by Smith. He is also the publisher of the wife’s self-titled magazine. It looks like the business is sought to go over the top, and readers will be updated.</p><h2>Wife| Who Is Dan Gasby Wife?</h2><p>Dan Gasby is one of the well-known businessmen, but there are other reasons to like the man too. One of the main being his better half wife, Barbara Smith.</p><p>Gasby is not married once but twice for sure. The name of the first wife is not known to anyone. One thing known about that marriage is the child <strong>Dana Gasby.</strong></p><p>After the breakup with the first wife, though Dan found another lady who is pretty special to him. Both of the lovebirds met in 1992 and never looked back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/dan-442.png><p>As they dated for some time, they walked down the aisle on 23rd December 1992 in a pretty close event. Smith, too was married earlier but got divorced. It was a great event with family and friends being invited to it.</p><p>Till this point in time, they don’t bore any kids but look like they look happy with each other. In 2014 though, Smith revealed the fact that she is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p>This news brought sadness to the family for sure. Looking at the thick of things, we feel they are happy at where they stand.</p><h2>Affairs</h2><p>One of the surprising news that came to the fore was about the affair of Dan. As his wife is sick and fighting the disease, this businessman is said to be dating another lady.</p><p><strong>Alex Lerner,</strong> whom Gasby met in 2017 at a bar and jelled up. Alex works at a New York restaurant and is the mother of three. This bonding was not liked by the fans, and it seems like the bond between Dan and Smith is not good.</p><p>Some of the viewers suggested the fact that it was a pity to be seeing another girl when the wife is sick. All of this has not affected the celebrity, and he is going on the merry ways.</p><h2>Net Worth| How Much Does Dan Gasby Earns?</h2><p>Being a businessman surely helps an individual to get a huge amount of bucks.

Although there is proper information on the net worth, nothing accurate can be said about the annual income and assets owned.</p><p>In his free time, Gasby loves to read and also travel. His passion for Italian food also remains on top of the chart.
