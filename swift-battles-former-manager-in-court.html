Dymtrow originally signed a then 14-year-old Swift in 2004 and claims that he had a key role in developing the young singer's career. Swift left Dymtrow in 2005, prior to signing the Big Machine Records contract that would lead to her 2006 breathrough album, the anonymously-titled "Taylor Swift."</p><p>According to The Hollywood Reporter, Dymtrow is claiming that his management agreement with Swift and her parents stipulated a commission of 5%-10% or more from Swift's career but maintains that after facilitating contact with industry figures, including Big Machine CEO Scott Borchetta, Dymtrow was fired to avoid paying the commissions.</p><p>"They delayed and delayed and got rid of my client and subsequently signed the deal [with Big Machine] and kept his commissions for themselves," an attorney for Dymtrow said.</p><p>Legal wrangling between Swift and Dymtrow have been quietly underway since 2007, when Dymtrow originally brought suit against Swift and her parents. In March 2010, a federal judge dismissed most of Dymtrow's claims against Swift, leaving only a complaint of unjust enrichment in place.</p><p>Both parties in the suit have filed a joint request to the court, seeking documents they believe will lend credence to their case. In the letter, according to THR, Dymtrow's attorneys cite a 2004 email from Swift, in which she allegedly writes, "Enough with the Dymtrow. You asked me to break both his legs, wrap him in chains and throw him in the lake. I did."</p><p>Swifts camp has dismissed Dymtrow's claims. "For him to claim that her success and her major contracts were procured by him is ludicrous," said Swift's lawyer, Paul LiCalsi of Mitchell Silberberg & Knupp.</p><p>According to Swift's attorney, Dymtrow never followed through with completing paperwork that would have made him eligible for his commissions. – CelebrityAccess Staff Writers</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaJuRlr%2BktMivnGirp56ztXnBmqutpJWoeqe70aacq2Wdlruis8SrZKKmXZi8tr7TaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
