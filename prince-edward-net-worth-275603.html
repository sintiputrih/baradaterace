Born Edward Antony Richard Louis on March 10, 1964, at Buckingham Palace, London, he is the fourth and youngest child of <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a> and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Once he graduated from Cambridge, Edward proceeded Master of Arts (Cantab) in 1991, thus becoming the fourth of only five Royal Family members in history to have gained a university degree. Spending three years in the Royal Marines, Prince Edward went on to become a theater producer.</p><p>Eventually, he formed his own television production company, while still performing official duties. Edward has pursued an interest in the arts and entertainment and worked as a production assistant at Weber's Really Useful Theatre Company. He eventually created Ardent Productions in 1993 and helped produce several documentaries and dramas. What's more, he is probably the only Queen's child not to cause a scandal, even though he was falsely accused to be homosexual. Publicly denying those falsehoods, Edward married Sophie Rhys-Jones, a public relations executive, in 1999. Once they tied the knot, the couple became the Earl of Wessex and Viscount Severn. They have two children together, a daughter and a son, who are known as Lady Louise Windsor and James, Viscount Severn. Prince Edward, currently the eighth in line to the throne, resides with his family at Bagshot Park in Surrey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmegp7avr8RmnJ2vkaexbrrErWSwp6KptW5%2Blm5taWs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
