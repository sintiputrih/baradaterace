And, while growing up in an orphanage, she was taught chess by the custodian ‘Mr. Shaibel’. Then soon, she became a strong player. In the orphanage, she struggles with an addiction to tranquilizers.</p><p>And, in her teens, Beth got adopted and started her rapid rise in the chess world. Therefore, subsequently challenged the top Soviet players. Moreover, as her skill and profile grow, her struggles with tranquilizers and alcohol worsen.</p><h2><span id=Beth_Harmon_8211_Development>Beth Harmon – Development</span></h2><p>Diana Lanni is a New York chess player present with Tevis. He contributed to the USA at the ‘1982 Chess Olympiad’ in Lucerne, suggesting she was at least in part the inspiration for the Beth Harmon character. Also, her friend Grandmaster ‘Larry Kaufman’ was the inspiration for the book’s Harry Beltik character.</p><p>Therefore, Diana believes it is plausible she got Tevis’ attention while playing at the outdoor tables at Washington Square Park as the only woman, and as someone with depression and addiction problems. And, other real-life chess players said to have inspired her include Bobby Fischer and Tevis himself.</p><p>Nevertheless, Tevis denied any of his characters were based on real-life people. And, he also said he found it more interesting to write a female character.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-119767 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Beth-Harmon-The-Irrish-Times.jpg alt="Beth Harmon" width=650 height=365 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-119767 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Beth playing chess.
