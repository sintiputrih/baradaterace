She has kept her life secret and nothing is known about her childhood. She is 28 years old as of 2023.&nbsp; According to our investigation, before relocating to Wahiawa, Hawaii, where she is presently residing, she was born and raised in Buffalo, Minnesota, where her mother still resides. Her youth was spent with her other siblings. Growing raised in Minnesota, she finished her education and graduated exclusively here.

She generally maintained her engagement in managing the day-to-day operations of her home and assisting her husband with various domestic tasks. Because her spouse is no longer alive, she may now begin working, and if she pursues a professional career, she will amass a large net worth.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Carlie has had no professional job since she married at a young age and did not begin working in any business area after marriage. She married when she was about 24 years old. But, before marriage, she aspired to be a successful businesswoman and worked briefly in the private sector.&nbsp;She began working as a Juvenile Counsellor at West Central Regional Juvenile Centre in 2017. She worked on this project for over 8 months before leaving.</p><h2>Carlie Madsen Husband & Marriage</h2><p><strong>Carlie Madsen</strong> had a fantastic love life before her husband died. On November 23, 2017, she proposed to Hudson Madsen. Prior to that, she said that she began seeing Hudson on January 15, 2017, and that they were engaged six months later. Carlie and Hudson chose to marry soon after becoming engaged, and they married on November 23, 2017. Following that, Carlie and Hudson Madsen began living happily together. Hudson was a huge fan of her wife. The couple eventually relocated to Wahiawa, Hawaii on August 18, 2019, since Hudson was serving in the United States Army. Carlie recently revealed that she had had surgery and thanked her husband profusely for his support through difficult periods in her life. She revealed Carlie has revealed more about her relationship with her husband, including the fact that they are set to begin fertility therapy in order to get pregnant. Hudson may be seen presenting Carlie a piggybank on a beach in the most recent picture Carlie has posted with her hubby. Her spouse was previously involved with Jeannine Bisignano.
