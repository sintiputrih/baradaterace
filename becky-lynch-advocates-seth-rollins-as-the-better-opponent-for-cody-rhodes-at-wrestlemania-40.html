The victory has guaranteed his ticket to the main event of WrestleMania 40 for a world championship match.</p><p>While The American Nightmare seemingly made it clear that it was Roman Reigns he wanted to go after, this week’s Monday Night RAW might have influenced Cody’s mind.</p><p>During an in-ring segment with current World Heavyweight champion Seth Rollins, he listened to him about the impact created by the aforementioned title since its inception last year, after Rollins told Cody to pick him as his WrestleMania opponent.</p><p>Seth reminded Cody Rhodes that Roman Reigns’ questionable title reign, infrequent appearances, and defenses were the main reason the World title was created. Moreover, he even named dropped his father, the late Dusty Rhodes stating that Seth’s title was the one that represented Dusty and that’s the kind of championship Cody should go after.</p><p>Rhodes ended the segment by saying that he would think about Rollins’ WrestleMania challenge. However, Seth’s wife and top star, Becky Lynch took <a href=#>to her Instagram story</a>, posting a clip from the face-off and advocating her husband’s prowess as a great champion and potentially a better opponent than Roman Reigns.</p><p>“There’s not one person better than @wwerollins.”</p><p>With The Man endorsing her man and her man’s choice of words hitting Cody Rhodes to reconsider his decision, it would be interesting to see what eventually Dusty’s kid decides for his WrestleMania main event.</p><p>Do you think Cody Rhodes will choose Seth Rollins instead? or will he stick to finishing the story with Roman Reigns?
