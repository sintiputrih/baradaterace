In the Cotswolds, standards – and expectations – have been raised higher and higher. Think handsome, honey-stone old inns with stylish interiors, great food and a good dose of luxury in the bedrooms. The best also retain their intrinsic local spirit, look hugely appealing with cosy fires and characterful rooms, and offer an epicurean sense of the area. From lively Tetbury to tucked-away Ebrington, here's our pick of the best pubs with rooms in the Cotswolds.</p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>A creeper-clad coaching inn turned arty, boutique haven. This rambling old property is furnished with immensely pleasing flair – a blend of tradition and contemporary chic. There are open fires, rugs on flagstone, wooden floors and retro school seats as dining chairs. The sophisticated menu offers great flavour combinations, the likes of roast parsnip and fennel salad with chestnuts, and mutton and apple pie with creamed potatoes. If there's space in the bar beforehand try an aperitif of Sloe Negroni. This is good walking country and there are several circular hikes from the doorstep. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>98</span></span><p>• The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">best hotels in the Cotswolds</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>Set in a tucked-away honey-stone village of much charm, this 16th-century pub combines the attributes of a relaxing local and a stylish retreat, with an old-school bar, dining room and eight gorgeous bedrooms, each styled by a different designer. The rural-chic inn is an appealing foodie venue, too, with an adventurous menu based on artisanal ingredients. Facilities range from a good-looking private dining room to an expansive and beautifully planted terrace garden featuring a wisteria-clad pergola. And there are several circular hikes from the doorstep in which to burn off a hearty meal. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>105</span></span><p>• The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">best family-friendly hotels in the Cotswolds</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>This hidden treasure set in a gloriously unspoilt village is a modern day version of a country tavern – complete with an inglenook fireplace, exposed beams and flagstone and wooden floors. It’s at once a genuine pub that brews its own very smooth ales, a lovely restaurant offering real local flavour, and a charming hotel with five rustic-stylish bedrooms. A happy spirit emanates from the mainly local staff. Great care has been taken in compiling a top 20 list of things to do, which is left in the bedrooms. This being an honest-to-goodness pub, facilities are limited – there’s a lovely walled garden and dining terrace. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>150</span></span><p>• The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">best Cotswolds hotels in and around Burford</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>This pub spills onto the expansive green of picturesque, honey-stone Bledington, with an old-fashioned see-saw just off its terrace; the village is in glorious walking and cycling country. The Kings Head is an appealingly meandering property offering a generous sense of space and plenty of snug corners. The oldest part dates back to the mid 1600s and there's a modern accommodation wing at the back. Décor is stylishly rural, with flagstone floors, rugs and old settles, and with a fireplace in one room, a wood burner in another. Good honest brasserie-style dishes based on seasonal ingredients are presented with flair. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>90</span></span><p>• The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">best boutique hotels in the Cotswolds</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>This old inn is in the centre of picture-pretty Kingham, opposite the village green and just down the road from the stylishly epicurean Wild Rabbit pub – a rival that keeps The Kingham Plough on its gourmet toes. Service takes the property to an altogether different level from other Cotswold pubs with rooms. In the restaurant, staff will give you enthusiastic chapter and verse on ingredients (all organic) and cooking techniques. There’s also a – very small – reception area where you can arrange to have treatments at Daylesford’s Haybarn spa. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>140</span></span><p>• The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">best hotels for spa breaks in England</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>This appealingly stylish old pub is set in a quiet lane on the outskirts of Ilmington, a pink-brick and golden-stone Warwickshire village. The pub dates back several centuries and has evolved from a collection of barns. There are snoozy leather armchairs in front of a big stone fireplace, and hunting pictures on the walls. All eight rooms have a sitting area; one has a four-poster, another a canopy bed decked in tartan. The food, based largely on local ingredients, is a treat, from fennel and pumpkin seed bread, to spiced vegetarian tagine and rump of lamb with pea puree. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>132</span></span><p>• The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">best luxury hotels in the Cotswolds</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>The Lion is a 16th-century coaching inn turned rustic-cool pub with rooms. Set in the heart of Winchcombe, which is regarded as the ‘walking capital’ of the Cotswolds, it makes a fine base for hiking weekends and touring ‒ and serves appealing brasserie food. A modern makeover has cleverly given the interior of this historic property a cosy yet light and bright look. It's a place of bleached wood, exposed stone walls and rugs on flagstone floors. The well-priced menu includes mains such as mushroom tagliatelle with spinach pesto to slow-roasted pork belly with creamed cabbage. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>110</span></span><p>• The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">best spa hotels in the Cotswolds</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>The Village Pub certainly does what it says on the tin ‒ it's an inn and local hub. Yet it's also a handsome place of much mellow charm and wide appeal. The central point is a proper bar area where you can pop in to enjoy a pint of local Windrush ale beside the woodburner, a framed Barnsley cricket club T-shirt above it reflecting pride in local involvement. Yet as with most pubs, this is now principally a restaurant – with a small, wholesome menu offering big flavours. The six bedrooms all have a contemporary-chic vibe with panelling, feature wallpaper here and there, soft throws, and pleasing headboards. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>190</span></span><p>• <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The most romantic hotels in the Cotswolds</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>From its gables, beams and fireplace to its craft beers, natural wine and wholesome menu, this 17th-century inn exudes charm and character. It enjoys broad appeal; locals come for a pint and a chat, weekenders descend from London, Birmingham and further afield. The Plough is set in a tucked-away honey-stone village, yet within fairly easy reach of Cheltenham. It’s cosy in winter, and offers outdoor terrace space in summer. Upstairs there are three cosy bedrooms under the eaves. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>99</span></span><p>• The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">best pubs with rooms in Kent</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>With its Art Deco piano and vintage jukebox, this lively old inn in handsome Tetbury has a funky-chic feel. Innovative, eco-sensitive, family-friendly and dog-friendly, it has a strong community vibe and offers good honest food with plenty of vegan options. Opposite the main pub building the former skittles alley has been converted into a six-bedroom annexe with stylishly comfy furnishings. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>75</span></span><ul class="travel-product-listing__items grid u-separator-bottom"><li class="travel-product-listing__item grid-col grid-col-12grid-col-sm-4"><a href=# class=product-summary__image-container data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a><span class=travel-product-listing__rating itemprop=reviewRating itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Rating><p class=product-rating data-ampclass=product-rating><span class=product-rating__value data-ampclass=product-rating__value>9</span> <span class=product-rating__label data-ampclass=product-rating__label>Telegraph expert rating</span></p></span><span class=travel-product-listing__body>Thyme, Caryn Hibbert’s Cotswolds haven, started as a cookery school and has evolved into an epicu...</span> <span class="link-wrapper link-wrapper--block" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span></li><li class="travel-product-listing__item grid-col grid-col-12grid-col-sm-4"><a href=# class=product-summary__image-container data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a><span class=travel-product-listing__rating itemprop=reviewRating itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Rating><p class=product-rating data-ampclass=product-rating><span class=product-rating__value data-ampclass=product-rating__value>9</span> <span class=product-rating__label data-ampclass=product-rating__label>Telegraph expert rating</span></p></span><span class=travel-product-listing__body>Barnsley House is an ultra-chic adults-only retreat set in a honey stone Cotswolds village.
