However, the Alexandria Safe Zone in The Walking Dead is not filmed in the Old Dominion. Instead, a real-life neighborhood in Senoia, Georgia is where the Alexandria scenes have been filmed for the past eight years.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true>What’s extraordinary about the Alexandria location is that some people actually live in the Senoia neighborhood where it’s filmed and are occasionally asked to turn off their lights at home or avoid certain streets when scenes are being filmed and are compensated for their troubles. As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a> noted:</p><p data-characters=129 data-current-count=129 data-injectable=false>&nbsp;“Currently, seven families live in the neighborhood, dubbed the Gin Property, five of whom have been there since 2014.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=429 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=226 data-injectable=false>Scott Tigchelaar, one of the residents in Senoia and a real estate developer who built 10 homes there, has even said Rick Grimes actor Andrew Lincoln once personally thanked him for letting them film in the neighborhood.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=518 data-injectable=true>AMC also built quite a few structures in the neighborhood for use in The Walking Dead. But amazingly, instead of building basic home facades with no interior amenities, AMC actually built 10 fully-functioning houses with full plumbing and HVAC. Those homes will now soon be up for sale.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=216 data-injectable=false>With The Walking Dead wrapping up their 11th and final season, it was also reported that the iconic corrugated metal walls of Alexandria — which were put in place to keep the zombies out — will soon be torn down.</p><p data-characters=119 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>The Walking Dead‘s final couple of episodes premiere weekly on Sundays, with the series finale airing on Nov. 20.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMSrnGaho2KurbHXmqWdqpmWeqq6jK2fnmWnlrmstc2gZJ2dkZl8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
