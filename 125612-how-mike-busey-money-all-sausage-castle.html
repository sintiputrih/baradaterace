Like the Playboy Mansion, this Mike Busey's house hosts prolific or wild sex parties. Before social media, the initial sausage parties were promoted by word of mouth.</p><h4><strong>How much is the Sausage Castle membership and does the Sausage Castle still exist?</strong></h4><p class=align-left>The Sausage Castle is primarily online for a $33 monthly membership fee. Members access exclusive content on the website and VIP admission to the house. According to Mike, the real parties are smaller after the Castle burnt down on January 11, 2017, reopening in 2018.</p><h3>Net worth</h3><p class=align-left>Currently, Mike Busey's net worth is approximately $1 million. At one point, he was worth $250. So, how did Mike Busey make all his money? Mike's profits increased when he started using social media to promote his parties by uploading videos to YouTube and MySpace.</p><p class=align-left>The first Sausage Castle back in 2001 accommodated 50,000 visitors. As a result, many club owners approached him to appear as a special guest or promoter. He started making $500 just for showing up at these events.</p><p class=align-left>Currently, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">rents out </a>rooms to athletes, celebrities, members, veterans, and the Busey Beauties at the Castle.</p><p class=align-left>Besides the Sausage Castle, he makes cash from live show memberships.

He also makes cash from global viewership.</p><h3>Mike Busey partner</h3><p class=align-left>Mike has not been very lucky in love, considering that the Sausage Castle is what he considers his longest, most reliable relationship. The owner of Sausage Castle has had numerous <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">flings and hookups</a>. But, from the look of things, he is single, so there is no Mike Busey partner or children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/8aa8552909e858b6.jpg><p class=align-left>Mike Busey's Sausage Castle may be unconventional and somewhat illegal, but to some, it is a place to express personal freedom and fulfill sexual fantasies.
