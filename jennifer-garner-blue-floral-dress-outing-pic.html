Jennifer also had her hair down and carried a black purse over one shoulder as she didn’t pay attention to cameras."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The singer <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>was seen</a> leaving the actor’s Brentwood area home on Friday and looked glowing as she sat in a large vehicle and looked out the window. He was also spotted taking his son <strong>Samuel</strong>, 9, whom he shares with his ex-wife Jennifer, to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>swim lessons</a> later that same day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jennifer-Garner-Blue-Floral-Dress-BACKGRID-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>J.Lo and Ben, who used to be engaged until they split back in 2004, first made headlines for rekindling their romance during a trip to Montana in Apr., shortly after she and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Alex Rodriguez</strong></a>, 45, broke up. Since then, they’ve been seen on various outings, including hangouts in Miami and the Los Angeles area, and were even spotted <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>passionately kissing</a> during a dinner date. Although the reunion is getting a lot of attention, Jennifer, who split from Ben in 2015, has been trying to avoid the media circus that her ex and his lady love are causing.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Jen doesn’t want anything to do with the media circus surrounding Ben’s rekindled romance with J.Lo,” a source <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>EXCLUSIVELY told&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife</strong></a>. “Her only concern is, and always has been, their kids and as long as he’s there for them as a father then she’s happy. Jen is absolutely fine with Ben dating J.Lo but she just doesn’t want to get caught up in the frenzy of it. She likes to keep her life somewhat private but supports whatever decision Ben makes as long as he’s happy, healthy, and makes their children a priority which he always has.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH13e5FrZqOdnqO2p7HRZp6aqp6av26uy66cZp6cpL%2BiuIydqZ6ro2K8tsDIp55mqJmYfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
