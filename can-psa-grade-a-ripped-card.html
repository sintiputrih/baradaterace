Many collectors and enthusiasts rely on PSA to evaluate the condition and authenticity of their cards. But what happens when a card is ripped? Can PSA still grade it? In this article, we will explore the factors that determine whether PSA will grade a ripped card and provide some insights on what collectors can do in such situations.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Understanding PSA Grading Standards</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>PSA follows strict grading standards to assess the condition of trading cards. These standards consider factors like centering, corners, edges, surface, and authenticity. The purpose of grading is to provide a standardized and reliable evaluation of a card's condition, which can greatly impact its value in the market.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The Impact of Ripped Cards</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>When it comes to ripped cards, PSA takes a firm stance. Ripped cards are generally not eligible for grading because they significantly compromise the structural integrity and aesthetics of the card. A ripped card is considered to be in poor condition and does not meet the minimum requirements set by PSA for grading.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Exceptions to the Rule</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>While ripped cards are generally not eligible for grading, there are a few exceptions where PSA may consider grading them. These exceptions are rare and depend on the specific circumstances surrounding the card. For example, if the card is of significant historical value or has extraordinary rarity, PSA might make an exception and evaluate the card on a case-by-case basis.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>PSA Encapsulation</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>In some cases, collectors may consider sending a ripped card to PSA for encapsulation rather than grading. Encapsulation involves sealing the card in a tamper-evident holder to preserve its current state. This can be a viable option for collectors who wish to protect and display their ripped cards, even though they may not be eligible for grading.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Alternative Options for Ripped Cards</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>For collectors with ripped cards that are not eligible for grading or encapsulation, there are still a few options to consider. One option is to seek professional restoration services. Restoration experts can repair and restore ripped cards, bringing them back to a presentable condition. However, it is essential to note that restored cards are often labeled as such and may not command the same value as unaltered cards.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>PSA does not typically grade ripped cards due to their compromised condition. Ripped cards are considered to be in poor condition and do not meet the minimum requirements for grading. However, there may be exceptions for cards of significant historical value or extreme rarity. For collectors with ripped cards, encapsulation or restoration may be alternative options. Ultimately, it is important to understand the impact of a ripped card on its value and explore the available options to preserve and display it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6cmKdloKiubrPRmpueZZFiv6q8z56bZpuRp7E%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
