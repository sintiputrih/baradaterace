Love is love.’</p><p>However, the two broke up for unknown reasons. During their relationship time, they attended several places together.

Busy day?</strong></h5><p>Yes, it’s been crazy busy, but with all the Brits I talk to, the only thing I wanna talk about is Brexit. So let’s not talk about me, let’s talk about you and the state of your economy.</p><h5><strong>OK. What was your first impression when you heard the news?</strong></h5><p>Well, I thought it was insanity! Just like I think Donald Trump running for president is insanity. Most British people I speak to here don’t seem to think it’s a good thing. How about you?</p><h5><strong>Well, we’re trying to look for a positive side.</strong></h5><p>Is there a positive side?</p><h5><strong>We need you to tell us that there’s a positive side.</strong></h5><p>I don’t know. I wish I could tell you. That’s what we’re trying to do with Donald Trump, but there will never be anything positive that comes out of that gentleman’s mind, mouth, anything. If he became president, I was gonna move to the UK, but now I’m not sure.</p><h5><strong>You must have some European family connections?</strong></h5><p>My father’s family is from Italy, and my moms are from Poland, so maybe I can scoot over to Rome or Warsaw? Let’s focus on something like horror films and cheer ourselves up!</p><h5><strong>I don’t scare easily, but&nbsp;</strong><strong>Lights Out</strong><strong>&nbsp;had me constantly feeling that something was going to leap out at me from somewhere.</strong></h5><p>I like to explain the movie as: you’re walking through the woods on a bright, sunny day. A twig snaps behind you. You look around. You see no one there. And suddenly twigs start breaking all around you and you don’t know where it’s coming from. And for an hour and a half, you’re running through the woods in the dark. That’s what it feels like to me.</p><h5><strong>You have done quite a few horror films in your career. Are you a fan? Did you read your son [2] The Human Centipede rather than The Hungry Caterpillar at bedtime?</strong></h5><p>My thing with this genre – I’m not really into it. I think the last horror film I saw was The Exorcist, as a kid. I don’t like bloody, gory things. But if it’s a good character, then for me it doesn’t matter what genre it is.</p><h5><strong>Your character in Lights Out could be haunted, or she could just be mentally ill.</strong></h5><p>If you take away the horror aspect of this movie, I believe it could play as a family drama. I play this mother who’s in the midst of depression, off her meds, on the verge of a psychotic breakdown and it affects her children. For me, that was pulled from real-life experience: not being able to get out of bed for three months at a time and not being able to see reality as it is.</p><h5><strong>How did you deal with it in real life?</strong></h5><p>I’m not sure if you read my book that came out last year?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1foq6ztcBmmZ6knKR6o7XOZpignV2jsKq%2FjJyjmqqVYrq2us1mn66rkpa7pXnToZxmpaWiurp5wKebZqiRp8GvsdFo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
