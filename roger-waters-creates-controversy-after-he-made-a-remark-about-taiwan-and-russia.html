The 78-year-old rock singer, in an exclusive interview with Michael Smerconish, discussed his reasoning for calling Vice President Joe Biden a “war criminal” on his This Is Not a Drill program.</p><p>“To begin, he is adding gasoline to the fire in Ukraine. That’s a serious offense. Why doesn’t the United States urge President [Volodymyr] Zelensky of [Ukraine] to talk so that this terrible conflict might be avoided?”</p><p>Waters criticized NATO’s role in the issue when Smerconish said that Roger was “blaming the party that was attacked.”</p><p>When did any battle begin, anyway?” Looking back at the past is all it takes to pinpoint the exact moment when anything first got going. One might argue that it all began in 2008… When [Mikhail] Gorbachev negotiated the exit of the Soviet Union from all of Eastern Europe, NATO made a guarantee not to go closer to the Russian border than necessary.&nbsp;While Smerconish said that the United States performs the role of liberator in international politics, Roger Waters asserted that the United States entered World War II because of Pearl Harbor.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Roger-Waters-2.jpg alt="Roger Waters" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“You used to be total introverts. The Russians had already won the war at that point, thank God. Twenty-three million Russians gave their lives to keep us safe from the Nazis.&nbsp;Smerconish was also advised by Waters to “go away and study a little more” about what the United States may do if China “were launching nuclear-armed missiles into Mexico and Canada.”</p><p>Then Smerconish spoke in and pointed out that China “Roger Waters said, “No time to talk, I’m too busy surrounding Taiwan right now.”</p><p>China and Taiwan are inseparable. Since 1948, the whole world community has unanimously agreed with the statement. That’s something you should know if you read at all, and if you don’t you should probably start. It seems that you have fallen for the propaganda of your own side. No discussion of human rights in Taiwan can take place without first reading up on the topic.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Roger-Waters-3.jpg alt="Roger Waters" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He then asked who China had “invaded and murdered” up to that point, pointing out that China “didn’t invade Iraq and kill a million people in 2013.” Smerconish retorted, “their own,” which triggered an angry response from Waters.</p><p>“Bullocks! It’s complete and utter bullshit! “That’s ridiculous!</p><h2>The internet erupted in controversy after hearing Roger Waters’ shocking statements.</h2><p>When the news tape of Roger Waters on national television went popular online, the Twitterati did not hold back their criticism of him. Quite a few people were outraged by Waters’s strong political opinions, and they made it clear that he should not remark on geopolitics since he did not know enough about the history of Russia and Taiwan.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>The host laughed at Roger Waters.<br>He didn’t even realize he made a fool of himself with his ignorance.<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/mAiqWsvrLm</a></p><p>— Zhang Heqing张和清 (@zhang_heqing) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">August 7, 2022</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>According to the Chinese garbage propaganda he was spewing about Taiwan it seems he has a choice of where to move.
