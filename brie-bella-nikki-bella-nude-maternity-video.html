This isn’t something either sister was pleased about.</p><p><a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photos-show-what-childbirth-looks-for-queer-and-non-binary-parents.jpg alt="gay couple parents kissing with baby" height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">These Childbirth Photos of LGBTQ Parents Show Love in Its Rawest Form</span></a></p><p>“Without you I’m fucking scared,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Nikki confessed to Brie</a> in the episode. “I feel like I’m going to come home with him and be like, what do I do? There’s not security there. With you, I have security and I have comfort, but I’m really scared to be a mom.”</p><p>Brie seemed to feel slightly abandoned too, especially since husband Bryan Danielson was on the road, leaving her and daughter Birdie on their own at home.</p><p>“Yeah, I know how to care for an infant. I’ve done it before, but I’ve never done it when there’s a toddler running around,” Brie said to her husband, expressing her worries.</p><p>So those are all the mixed emotions the sisters were carrying with them as they stripped down for their shoot.</p><p>“I just can’t believe this is going to be the last time we’re going to be pregnant together,” Brie said.</p><p>But they managed to joke around and have fun in front of the camera too. As they were posing together, Brie warned that they were fine getting close, “As long as our boobs don’t touch because we get weird about that.”</p><p>Everyone’s got their limits!</p><p><strong>These gorgeous photos show <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">moms who love their postpartum bodies</a>.</strong></p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/postpartum-boudoir-slideshow.jpg alt="Pospartum boudoir photography" width=1024 height=768 sizes="(min-width: 87.5rem) 1000px, (min-width: 78.75rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jqmYq52eqbavs46aqa2hk6GytHuRbG9tcWBtfKO%2ByJ5km52coa5uusikoqJlkpq5ra2Mp6ydnV2irrWx0aegrbFdq7alsc5o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
