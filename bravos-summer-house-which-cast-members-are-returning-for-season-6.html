That's right, Bravo’s Summer House is back to heat up the East Coast beaches as usual. In general, fans have great expectations for the new season because season 5 was somewhat limited by the global pandemic and portrayed a quarantine setting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now that filming can continue as normal, the show will probably revert to the regular format. However, there appear to have been a few additions and others leaving the show. Here are the cast members that will be returning in the new season.</p><h2 id=lindsay-hubbard><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Lindsay Hubbard</span></h2><p>Lindsay Hubbard has been part of the Summer House team since the show debuted in 2017 and is currently one of its oldest members. In general, the star is known for her series of emotionally unsettled relationships she‘d been having all through the previous five seasons. Right from her first on-screen boyfriend, Everett Weston down to her newest ex Stephen, Hubbard has been going from one unsuccessful fling to the other. Will she finally find love in the new season? Let’s wait to find out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 ‘Summer House’ Feuds That Left Fans Divided</a></span></p><h2 id=carl-radke><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Carl Radke</span></h2><p>Ever since Carl Radke joined the Summer House cast in season one he’s been a fan favorite, even though he started off as a bit of a player. Following the conclusion of the last season, the star had been pretty occupied. Although the year 2020 was generally hard for everyone, it hit Radke particularly hard because he lost his brother, and that sent him to a bad place. Now, he is doing a lot better, as he recently told Watch What Happens Live host, Andy Cohen, about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his 92 days of sobriety </a>on the reunion episode. He is set to feature in season 6 and is looking forward to telling fans all about his sobriety journey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=danielle-olivera><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Danielle Olivera</span></h2><p>Unlike some of the other cast members, Danielle Olivera joined Summer House in its second season. Although she joined a season late, the Bravo star somehow already had history with fellow cast member, Carl Radke. Olivera is one of the few Reality TV stars who represents the Latinx community.</p><p>However, for reasons unknown to fans, the star is the only cast member to have never been featured on Watch What Happens Live in her four years on the show. The topic has been controversial over the years, and fans hope for a change in the new season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kyle-cooke><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kyle Cooke</span></h2><p>Kyle Cooke aka party boy is one of the OGs, as he joined the Summer House cast in its first season. Cooke is loved by fans always being down to party. In the early days of the show, the star was seen as the young frat boy which he was at the time. Now, the star is all grown up as he recently got <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">married to Amanda Batula</a>, who he met on the reality show. Cooke will appear in the new season to give us another dose of his charm.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Cast Of Bravo's 'Summer House' Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=ciara-miller><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Ciara Miller</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ciara Miller is one of the new faces in Bravo’s Summer House. She joined the show in its fifth season, as a “friend” of Luke Gulbranson. Miller is an extensively <a href=#>successful</a> supermodel and is also the only cast member who was an essential worker. While the show was going on, it became clear as day that Luke had something for her, and taking a look at her Instagram, we can see why. Miller on the other hand was perfectly fine with remaining just friends with Luke. Let's see if that will change in the new season.</p><h2 id=amanda-batula><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Amanda Batula</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like her husband Kyle Cooke, Amanda Batula is also one of the earliest members of the Summer House team. She met Cooke late in 2015, and the duo began their relationship shortly after. Although fans have watched Batula get up to a lot of shenanigans, they also got to watch her fall in love with Cooke. The star is set to feature in the new season, and fans can’t wait to see what she will be getting up to next.</p><h2 id=paige-desorbo><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Paige DeSorbo</span></h2><p>Paige DeSorbo has been in the headlines ever since filming Summer House’s spinoff, Winter Charm with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Southern Charm</a> star Craig Conover and others. There have been several rumors suggesting that DeSorbo and Conover might be in a relationship. The duo first met at Kyle Cooke’s birthday party while Summer House was filming its fourth season. Ever since fans claimed to have seen the pair in public several times and can’t wait to hear about it in the new season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Is ‘Summer House’ Star, Paige DeSorbo Worth?</a></span></p><h2 id=luke-gulbranson><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Luke Gulbranson</span></h2><p>hthttps://www.instagram.com/p/CVa2ZYerG5k/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p><p>Luke Gulbranson climbed up the ranks really fast to become a fan favorite on the show even though he just joined the team in season 4. Not only did fans fall for Gulbranson right from the moment stepped into the house two summers ago, so did some of the women in the house.</p><p>However, he appeared to only have eyes for <a href=#>Hannah Berner</a>, who is no longer part of the team. While the duo was together, Gulbranson was seeing other women as they were never official. All of this drama is what the star brings to the table, and fans expect even more from him in the new season.</p><h2 id=andrea-denver><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Andrea Denver</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Andrea Denver is one of the new faces that will be joining the Summer House cast in season 6.

The Italian star is known for his good looks, and we can’t wait to see what he gets up to in the house.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Everything We Know About The ‘Southern Charm’ And ‘Summer House’ Mashup Series</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq5mmpMBuv9SmpJ6qXZ28tr%2FEZq6hoZOdeqSt0q1kpp2dl7Kzv4yaqZ5loprBtr7NoqWgZZakv26%2FxJqqqKZda3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
