She remarked:</p><p>I’m not bothered by it. Margot Robbie is on the line. Are you for real? She is exceptional. I’m quite proud of her. Parallels don’t bother me at all. It would be great to move past that, though.</p><p>Additionally, several Twitter users have remarked on Mackey’s uncanny resemblance to Margot Robbie from The Wolf of Wall Street. Barbie, Robbie’s upcoming film, also features Mackey. Find out what Emma Mackey had to say about being compared to Margot Robbie and her upcoming movie by reading on.</p><p>On September 14, Emma Mackey talked about how some people have compared her to Margot Robbie in an interview with Total Film.</p><p>She stated that the likeness is “amusing” and “a joke” (via GamesRadar+). “It’s just funny. Margot, bless her, I think had the grace and intelligence to capitalize on that, allowing me to be in the same photo as her. It’s only a joke. We don’t even remotely resemble one another, I guess.</p><p>When news broke earlier this year that Mackey had joined the cast of Margot Robbie’s Barbie, many fans were ecstatic. Since then, a lot of people have been contrasting the two actresses’ looks on social media.</p><p>In a conversation with Total Picture, Mackey referenced Barbie’s tone in passing and described it as “surprise,” but she withheld a lot of other information. According to her, (GamesRadar+):</p><p>“It’s unusual. One of the best scripts we’ve ever read, in our opinion. It’s surprising in many ways. People will already have an idea of the movie in their heads, and I don’t think it will be that. It will catch you off guard.</p><p>She continued by stating that there would be no sobbing in the comedy:</p><p>“Stop crying! Performing pure humor, especially American comedy, was amazing. And I got to work with incredible heroes.</p><p>She also expressed a wish to work with Barbie director Greta Gerwig during the conversation. She praised Gerwig and referred to her as her “idol.”</p><h2>Barbie is everything</h2><p>One of the most eagerly awaited movies of 2023 is Barbie, which is about the well-known and adored titular character.</p><p>However, very little is known about the movie, and the contents of the plot are currently being kept a secret. Along with Ryan Gosling, Emma Mackey, Kate McKinnon, America Ferrera, and Simu Liu, Margot Robbie plays the title role.</p><p>The film is directed by Greta Gerwig and is based on a story by Noah Baumbach, who also wrote Marriage Story. Gerwig has helmed several critically acclaimed movies, including Little Women, Frances Ha, and Lady Bird, to name a few.</p><p>Similarly, there are currently no known details on Emma Mackey’s involvement in the movie, even though sources claim she will play a crucial part.</p><p>Most recently, Mackey appeared in Kenneth Branagh’s critically acclaimed movie Death on the Nile. Last year, she made an appearance in the romantic drama movie Eiffel. In Emily, a biopic based on the life of renowned English author Emily Bronte, she also stars as Emily.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Juan Williams Of Fox News Quits The Five! 43 Years Married Life</a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>actor</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Jennifer Billingsley</a></h3>Jennifer Billingsley estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
