The numbers are particularly important for a few reasons—we'll get to those later. Though what stuck out is the special had much less comedy than expected.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike his previous <a href=#>standup</a> sessions where the crowds break out in laughter every few minutes, 8:46 was strangely somber, albeit with intermittent laughs here and there. Chappelle put aside the usual setup of a hilarious icebreaker to talk about an important topic that's left the world reeling.</p><p>In his intro, Chappelle shines a spotlight on <a href=#>George Floyd</a> in the wake of his death. The Minneapolis man died after an officer held his knee down on Floyd's neck for eight minutes and forty-six seconds.</p><h2 id=dave-chappelle-drops-surprise-netflix-special>Dave Chappelle Drops Surprise Netflix Special</h2><p>Floyd's death has sparked protests across the globe, all of which are speaking to the inequality we face today. Chappelle sought to remind his audience of what was going on because it's been happening for years. He follows up the conscious reminder by elaborating on a more complex issue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's What Netflix Is Doing To Support Black Lives Matter</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>As the Black Lives Matter movement pushes on and civilians step up to have their voices heard, public figures are asking celebrities and people in Hollywood to make a statement. But what reporters like Don Lemon fail to see is that no one wants to hear what their favorite comedian thinks right now.</p><h2 id=comedians-don-t-need-to-be-the-loudest-right-now>Comedians Don't Need To Be The Loudest Right Now</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blm-the-bold-italic.jpg><p>Dave Chappelle makes an excellent point during this particular segment, clarifying that celebrities don't need to make this movement about them. People on the protest's front lines are already doing this. And their voices should be heard, not those of comedians.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The legendary comedian elaborates further by ensuring his fans know that his taking a backseat in the movement isn't him being complicit. Chappelle has been talking about these injustices for years, he's done his part, and the next generation is picking it up at a crucial juncture in history.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Comedian Ron Funches Talks With Conan O' Brien About Racism In America</a></span></p><p>As far as the title of Chappelle's standup goes, its meaning will likely hit home even harder for readers.</p><p>When Chappelle explains how horrific the ordeal must have been for George Floyd as he laid there dying, he talks about the length of time and how terrifying it was for a man who knew he wouldn't be going home.</p><h2 id=why-8-46-is-so-shocking-to-chappelle>Why 8:46 Is So Shocking To Chappelle</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/flody-NY-Times-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To give the audience a comparison of the type of fear Chappelle saw in Floyd's eyes and heard in his pleas, he talks about experiencing an earthquake for the first time. He recalls Los Angeles' big one in 1993 and tells the crowd how those thirty-five seconds of shaking made him feel like it was the end, like he was going to die. Chappelle obviously didn't die, but the memory left a lasting impression on him because that same level of fear he felt during those brief moments, was the same emotion Floyd felt for almost nine minutes, and during his final minutes still alive.</p><p>What shook Chappelle is that the time of 8:46 is the same time he was born. The comedian explains that he was born at 8:46 on the morning of August 24, 1973. It's merely a coincidence, but that doesn't change the fact that a time once used to commemorate someone's birth now represents how long it took for a police officer to end another person's life. And that fact will be hard to shake.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Madonna Shares Her Son's Tribute Video In Honor Of George Floyd</a></span></p><p>Chappelle makes one other very poignant dig during his stand-up, and it's at Candace Owens. The political activist has been using her platform to say she doesn't support George Floyd. She also posted Floyd's criminal history online in an attempt to weaken sympathy for him. Luckily, comedians like Chappelle are stepping up to check her.</p><h2 id=candace-owens-doesn-t-support-george-floyd>Candace Owens Doesn't Support George Floyd</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/owens-Youtube-1.jpg><p>When Chappelle gets to his response to Owens, he says he doesn't care what Floyd did before his death. Chappelle uses more colorful language to express his sentiment, but it's hard to argue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Regardless of what Floyd has done in the past, the use of excessive force isn't a new concept. No one deserves to have their life snuffed out in such a cruel manner, and Owens trying to make Floyd out to be the bad guy completely ignores the fact that he was a human being. And because of that, he's not the monster she purports Floyd is. Instead, the Minneapolis man is now a hero because his death sparked a movement that should've happened a long time ago.</p><p>Whether you like Dave Chappelle's comedy or not, 8:46 is one special that should be considered required viewing in today's day and age. It touches on a lot of relevant events, and the performance will also go down in history as one of the first live concerts following the latest lockdown. Having been viewed over 18 million times in just five days also makes the stand-up sound very appealing to new fans of Chappelle's comedy.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Reject Famous Stars That Turned Down Saturday Night Live</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmq6VYrCprc%2BpnKWklWK0sLHSZp%2BaqpRitq95y5qrnqukYsC1rc2dZK6oXai9pq%2FImqNmnqKasm7AzmaumqyTnXqwuoyypq6spZeycA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
