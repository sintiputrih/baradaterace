Do whatever you are doing with your feet above your head.” Even after Tuesday morning’s event, she said she was going to sit for 15 minutes that way. After wearing nude block-heels with her red ensemble all morning, she wanted to make sure she gets the blood flowing back in the opposite direction.</p><p>“No one, not man, not woman, were meant to be walking in heels,” she said. “But again we’re doing for the clothes, the style and the fashion.” After all, the phrase “pain is beauty” is a cliché for a reason!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Freid-Pinto-Red-Carpet-Secrets-Inline-2.jpg><p>Obviously, with comfort being a priority, Clarks is a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">natural partnership</a> for the 34-year-old.

Making them feel like they’re in charge is maybe the number one goal.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5u%2FprXDmmSpoZ6pvG68zqyrZqqVmXqkrdGpnK1lop7Btq3LZp2oql2ptrOxw2adnp2kZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
