But the barber had a quick comeback, writing, “You not tired of the Travis Kelce fade.”</p><p>Travis has become known for his fade over the years, even before his high-profile relationship with Swift, leading him to be the subject of various memes and jokes. Travis acknowledged the attention around his hair during a press conference before this year’s Super Bowl, describing it as “absolutely ridiculous.”</p><p>“I got a good fade if you need it though. It’s a two on top and a nice high-to-mid fade with a taper in the back,” he said. “I didn’t invent that.

That’s not his style.”</p><p>Travis was <a href=#>recently in Australia to join Taylor</a> for her Down Under performances (where<a href=#> her father allegedly assaulted a photographer</a>), and reports say he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">also wants to come along to Europe</a>.
