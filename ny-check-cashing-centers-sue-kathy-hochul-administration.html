I have always viewed the store as an important part of the community. Even during the pandemic, Check Changers did its best to work with the community to remain open and accessible,” said Margie Simmons, a longtime customer at the Check Changers Gravesend.</p><p>“I have limited mobility and there are no other check cashers in the area,” she said. “When this location closes it will be devastating to me and others in the community. The government might think it is doing what is best for me, but it is wrong.”</p><p>A 2022 assessment conducted for the&nbsp;check-cashing industry by the accounting firm Ernst & Young claimed the decline in revenues from the limitation in fees would make the check cashiers “unprofitable” and force closures.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Mylan Denerstien represented former Gov.

Check cashers should not be entitled to automatic, annual fee increases just because their services are essential to many New Yorkers.” &nbsp;</p><p>She said rules issued back in 2005 made New York the only state in the nation to grant annual, automatic increases ib check-cashing fees, pegging hikes to a measure of inflation by way of the Consumer Price Index, which broadly tracks changes in cost of living for consumers.</p><p>Before Harris took over the department when Hochul became governor, check cashers received three increases — in December 2019, March 2020 and February 2021. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xma3Bfo8Zur8eemqRlk5bAqbXNoGScnZ6psrO%2FjKysnmWblsGpxYyhppygpaF6orDMoqWiq6SnrrW1zqdm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
