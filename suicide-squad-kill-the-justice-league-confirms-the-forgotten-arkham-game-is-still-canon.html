But there’s one notable exception from the exhibit: 2013’s Arkham Origins.</p><h2 id=h-the-ignored-arkham-game data-injectable=false>The ignored ‘Arkham’ game</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true>Developed by WB Montreal rather than Rocksteady, this prequel to Arkham Asylum is set early in Batman’s career when he’s an urban legend feared and hated by the GCPD. The game shows Batman’s first encounter with the Joker and the beginning of his friendship with Commissioner Gordon, as well as rounding out his motivations and character.</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>But, sadly, Origins has been almost entirely ignored in recent years. It’s failed to appear on the HD re-releases and, at first glance, Suicide Squad also seems to pretend it didn’t happen. But there’s a very obscure Easter Egg that indicates Origins is definitely still canon.</p><h2 id=h-the-night-of-the-assassins data-injectable=false>The ‘Night of the Assassins’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chrome_2024-02-02_12-13-26.png><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>Arkham Origins story is driven by Black Mask putting a hit out on Batman and inviting eight of the world’s top assassins to compete against one another for the prize. They are: Deathstroke, Bane, Copperhead, Firefly, Electrocutioner, Killer Croc, Shiva, and Deadshot. The bounty is only available for one night, Christmas Eve.</p><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=757 data-injectable=true>This is directly referenced in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. In the opening cutscene, we see into Deadshot’s cell in Arkham where, just to his left there’s an issue of the Gotham City Herald newspaper with the headline “Night of the Assassins”. So, while the game isn’t dwelling on Origins‘ story, it’s clear that as far as Rocksteady is concerned, the game is still canon.</p><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false>The only thorny question remaining is that the Suicide Squad Deadshot doesn’t seem to be the same as the Arkham Origins Deadshot (without getting into why this is explained in the game), but we guess this version is merely keeping track of the other assassin who cares his codename.</p><p data-characters=48 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>Now, where’s the HD re-release of Origins?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZoqq6hk56xpnnSqqyanF2gtq24jK2fnmWaqsC1tcKeZKWdkZzCpnnCqKWfoaKiwG7Ax55kn6einLy1wMSnZJqqm52urnnGmqSeZZmoerTAyKWjZpuRo7yvew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
