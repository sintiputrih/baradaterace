His journey, however, began far earlier – from the moment he completed his high school education, his path was paved with a drive for excellence. This drive led him to the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, where he enrolled in 2006. The culmination of his educational journey saw him become a proud 2010 alumnus, earning dual Bachelor of Science degrees in Broadcast Journalism and Sport Management.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>During his time at Syracuse University, Elken’s dedication extended beyond the classroom. He actively engaged with various student organizations, including WAER, Z89, CitrusTV, and even the SU Ski Team. These experiences not only enriched his understanding of journalism but also honed his skills in various facets of media.</p><p>Elken’s journey into professional journalism began with his tenure at The University of Texas at El Paso, where he lent his voice as a play-by-play commentator for two and a half years. His prowess as a storyteller was further amplified during his four-and-a-half-year stint as the sports director in Dayton, Ohio. In this role, he not only delivered sports news but also infused his reporting with a unique blend of insight and enthusiasm.</p><p>Erik Elken’s journalistic odyssey continued as he transitioned to Ohio, where he secured a position at KEZI. Here, he embraced the responsibilities of an anchor and reporter, showcasing his adaptability and versatility in the field. His dedication to his craft was further underscored by his role as the play-by-play announcer for the Tri-City ValleyCats, a Single-A affiliate of the Houston Astros.</p><p>Elken’s journey has been defined not only by his professional accomplishments but also by his deep-rooted connection to his native home, Albany, New York. While his career demands dedication, he masterfully balances it with his love for family, skiing, and travelling. Beyond the newsroom, he finds solace in being an ardent fan of sports teams like the Syracuse Orange, New York Mets, New York Giants, and the New York Rangers, exemplifying his strong connection to his roots.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-is-erik-elken-going-after-leaving-kiva><strong>Where is Erik Elken going after leaving KIVA?</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Erik Elken and Estela Casas, the news anchors for Channel 7-KVIA, will have a new co-anchor from Dayton, Ohio.
