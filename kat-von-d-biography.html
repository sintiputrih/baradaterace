They split in August 2007.</p><p>Kat dated American musician, producer, and director, Alex Orbison for about a year. He was often seen on her LA Ink reality show when the two were dating. An inexplicable lack of interest on Kat’s part led her to break up with Orbi in 2008 leaving him heartbroken and resentful.</p><p>Orbi confessed to a friend via a MySpace post that Kat made major promises of love and he fell for them very seriously after staying single for 5 years. He felt betrayed by how conveniently she fell out of love with him considering how smitten she was when they first met.</p><p>Kat is extremely fond of Scandinavian bands and spends a lot of time with musicians from that territory for a brief period that she might be dating Finnish musician, Ville Valo.</p><p>But, Kat went public with her relationship with<a href=#> Nikki Sixx</a> soon after, so that rumor did not last. Kat justified on her MySpace account back in 2008 that dating Nikki, co-founder of the Motley Crue band, as a result of their long-term acquaintance and friendship. Kat was a huge fan of Nikki’s music and they got involved only after her alignment to Orbi was history.</p><p>In 2009, Kat could not stop singing the praises of Nikki stating, she learned a lot from him and the two shared a mutual love for reading books. However, this was not meant to last and right at the beginning of 2010, Nikki announced an amicable split.</p><p>Jesse James, the famous reality star and motorcycle and car customizer, cheated on his then-wife, <a href=# rel=noopener>Sandra Bullock</a> in 2010 which ended his 5-year long marriage to her. Kat Von D was Jesse’s rebound right after the couple split and gained much notoriety in the tabloids as a result.</p><p>Kat felt genuine sympathy for Jesse since the tabloids were projecting him as an absolute villain. They got engaged in January 2011 only to call it off in July later that year. Though Jesse managed to win Kat in August, before the year was over, Kat publicly revealed that Jesse cheated on her with multiple women that led to a messy, hostile end to their brief relationship.</p><p>Kat’s love for music helped her find love again with a famous Canadian DJ and Music Producer, Deadmau5 (or Joel Zimmerman). But, even this relationship was every bit volatile as the previous one. The two got engaged and Kat happily talked about her wedding plans on the <a href=#>Wendy Williams</a> show.</p><p>They unexpectedly called off their engagement in November 2012 but got back together as the year came to an end. Six months later, a bitterly upset Kat permanently ended her relationship with Joel stating on her Twitter account that his infidelity and lies were to be blamed as the primary reason behind their split.</p><p>Kat started dating Hollywood stuntman, Steve-O, most famous for his crude comic reality stunt series and film series, Jackass. Steve confirmed his relationship with Kat on Instagram reaffirming his faith in Kat’s lifestyle and values. However, by March 2016, both Steve and Kat deleted all the pictures with each other from their respective social media accounts confirming the end of their relationship.</p><p>In 2016, artist, author, and musician, <strong>Rafael Reyes</strong> first met Kat Von D when she appeared in one of his music videos. Then, he wrote another song especially for her and she contributed her vocals to that song also.</p><p>They married on 21 February 2018. Later, in June 2018, they threw a party for their marriage. The couple has one child, son Leafar Von D Reyes (b. December 2018).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Kat_Von_D></span>Who is Kat Von D?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><strong>Kat Von D</strong> is a Mexican-American tattoo artist, model, musician, author, entrepreneur, and television personality.</h3><p>Likely, she is best known for her work as a tattoo artist on the TLC reality television show LA Ink, which premiered in the United States on August 7, 2007, and ran for four seasons.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kat_Von_D_Age_Parents_Siblings_Ethnicity></span>Kat Von D: Age, Parents, Siblings, Ethnicity<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kat Von D was <strong>born</strong> on 8th March 1982 in Montemorelos, Nuevo León, Mexico.
