The 1979 movie Caligula contained so much sex and violence in a mainstream motion picture that the audience couldn’t believe their eyes. This movie, based on the Roman emperor who reigned from 37 to 41 A.D., is allegedly as egregiously inaccurate as it is graphic. The film stars Malcolm McDowell as the eponymous leader and Helen Mirren as his fourth and final wife, Milonia Caesonia."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Nonetheless, it became a cult classic for its contributions to the exploitation genre.</span></p><p>The scene in which Caligula cuts the fetus of a child he bore with his sister, Drusilla, out of her body is utter fiction. Dando-Collins said this particular part is “great if you’re a horror film fan,” but not as strong in terms of historical accuracy.</p><p>“Drusilla died in a pandemic, and as far as we know wasn’t pregnant at the time,” he said. “Caligula was devastated by her death and had her declared a goddess, but that’s as far as his devotion to her went.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to The Harvard Crimson</a>, scenes like this led the film to come under such intense public scrutiny that a Boston Municipal Court deliberated about its potential criminality the year after its release.</p><p>“I feel very strongly about First Amendment rights, but I don’t think you’d find me testifying for one of those pictures at North or South Station,” said Harvard’s former associate dean of the faculty for undergraduate education and former professor of Greek and Latin, Glen Bowersock.</p><p>Unlike Dando-Collins, Bowersock said he told the court during his three-hour testimony that the film was largely faithful to the truth.</p><p>“I’m not arguing that it’s a great movie, but as far as its historical side is concerned, it is exact,” said Bowersock.</p>A scene from the 1979 classic, Caligula.<p>Ultimately, just how accurate the film’s rather experimental, avant-garde depiction of Caligula really was is almost beside the point for Bowersock, who claimed historians often dismiss the film due to its explicit nature.</p><p>“If there’s one lesson to be learned from this film, it’s that it is not good to ignore a historical period because it is unpleasant,” Bowersock argued. “Sometimes one needs to be reminded of these things.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyuu9WinKxlkpbAprCMqKVmrKKqsm6%2F06ipop2jZIQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
