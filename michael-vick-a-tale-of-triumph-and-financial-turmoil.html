He was heavily recruited as one of the best high school quarterbacks in the country before becoming a record-setting quarterback at Virginia Tech, where he was, on track to be the Heisman Trophy winner. Vick went on to play 13 seasons in the National Football League&nbsp; primarily with the Atlanta Falcons, and Eagles,&nbsp;earning three Pro Bowl selections.</p><p><br data-mce-fragment=1>Vick made an immediate impact in the NFL, starting for the Falcons, and was named to the NFC Pro Bowl team in his second year with the same team. His exceptional athletic prowess, arm strength, and abilities were appreciated and in 2004 he signed a record-breaking $130 million contract extension with Atlanta which was the biggest deal ever seen by the league at that period.</p><h2>Trouble Ahead</h2><p>Although he experienced early success, Vick's career took a sinister turn in 2007 when authorities uncovered an illegal dogfighting ring on a property he owned in Virginia. He was federally indicted as a result, landing him with 23 months of prison.</p><h2>Financial Turmoil</h2><p>Legal problems and an NFL suspension kept Vick from his first love for 18 months, costing him millions in earnings. It also led to him serving time in prison, losing all of his endorsement deals, and voluntarily filing for bankruptcy in July 2008, owing creditors $17.6 million (Dh64m). Yet, in an incredible twist of fate, Vick whipped out his checkbook and paid anywhere from $625,000 up to the entire final $1.5 million to creditors — making him a total of $17.4 million back on what was owed: A feat nearly unheard-of in bankruptcy cases.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Path to Redemption</h2><p>Vick overcame off-field obstacles, battling financial problems throughout his comeback in the NFL. He was then reinstated and signed with the Philadelphia Eagles, where he went on to be named the league's Comeback Player of the Year for 2010.</p><h2>The Aftermath</h2><p>What followed the next few seasons of his career to back that handsome task up, were injuries, new teams, and a decline in his on-field performance. He eventually retired in 2017 after a career with the NFL fraught with difficulties, yet seasoned by triumph.</p><h2>The Lessons Learned</h2><p>Vick's story is a strong reminder that life can be unpredictable, and you never know what the future may hold so it's always important to make sure your financial house is in order. Down but not out with legal and financial battles of epic proportions, he managed to find ways to pay off a vast majority of the money owed and reconstructed his career.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0miln6RforaktMCeo2aumZi4bq2MrZilnV2ks27A0aKspqiYYq6vsIyfoKeZnpi2oriMrayrpZ%2BeuQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
