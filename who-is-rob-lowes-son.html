It turns out that Ellis’ son, Jackson, is played by his real-life son. While this isn’t the first time that the father and son duo have appeared on screen together, it is certainly their first co-starring appearance, which is probably pretty special for the both of them.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=189 data-current-count=189 data-injectable=false>While we have a pretty good understanding of who Rob Lowe is with his extensive career and acting resume, we may not be as familiar with his son – so here’s everything you need to know.</p><h2 id=h-who-plays-rob-lowe-s-son-in-unstable data-injectable=false>Who plays Rob Lowe’s son in Unstable?&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/john-owen-lowe.png><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>Rob Lowe’s son and Unstable co-star is John Owen Lowe. Born in 1995, Lowe is around 28 years of age. Much like how Ellis introduces Jackson to the family business in Unstable, Rob Lowe very much passed the torch on to John with getting him a start in Hollywood. Per his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb profile</a>, John Owen Lowe made his acting debut in 2014 in a short titled A Canine Affair.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=641 data-injectable=true>John Owen would then go on to make appearances in two of his father’s other projects, The Grinder and Holiday in the Wind. Lowe’s son also had a role in Grace Point, which was released in February 2023, before finally starring alongside his father in Unstable.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=230 data-injectable=false>John Owen Lowe is also credited as a writer in his and his father’s latest Netflix comedy, and also has a writing credit in 9-1-1: Lone Star. John’s mother is Sheryl Berkoff, to whom Rob Lowe has been married since 1991.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxloqSvbrjOsJysZaOku3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
