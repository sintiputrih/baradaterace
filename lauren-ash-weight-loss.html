Some signs and symptoms of PCOS are acne, thinning hair, and weight increase.</p><p>In June 2022, Lauren revealed her long-hidden struggle with a chronic disease. The Actress posted an image of herself before and after receiving medical attention for the condition, along with a simple, open message to her followers. She detailed the effects PCOS has had on her over the years in it.</p><p>Five years ago today, the photo on the left was shot. Due to PCOS, I needed an urgent operation to remove recurrent cysts from my right ovary.

Others say they worry about your health while you live in a more extensive body. Besides a picture of herself in May 2022 that showed off her new body, Lauren said that women couldn’t win. “But when you go from a more extensive body to a smaller one, people worry about your health.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Lauren Ash (@laurenelizabethash)</a></p><p>Lauren says she didn’t lose weight because of a bad diet or an operation.</p><p>And to the many people asking me what my “secret” is, I beg you to stop.
