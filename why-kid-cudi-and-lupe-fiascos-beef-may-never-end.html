However, the two didn’t have their first public exchange until 2014, when Fiasco <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted his going rate for personalized verses</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I will personalize a 1 verse song for you. $500.
