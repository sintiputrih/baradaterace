It is here that his plans are revealed, the capture of the one Pokémon that is awake for only seven days every 1,000 years, the Wish Pokémon <a href=# title="Jirachi (Adventures)">Jirachi</a>. As he lays over the unconscious Noland, Guile mulls over the fact that out of the seven days Jirachi is awake he only has five days left to look for it, he laughs as he challenges the <a href=# title="Emerald (Adventures)">one</a> who is trying to stop his plans.</p><p>He makes his next appearance at the <a href=# title="Artisan Cave">Artisan Cave</a> where he stops Emerald's attempt to capture Jirachi with a <a href=# title="Timer Ball">Timer Ball</a> by slicing it in two. He briefly battles Emerald and manages to cut off one of his extendable hands but the boy ignores it, catches his hand, and runs off after Jirachi. Guile counters this by releasing several <a href=# title="Rental Pokémon">rental Pokémon</a> to chase after him, he then finds himself surrounded by the Frontier Brains <a href=# title=Lucy>Lucy</a>, <a href=# title=Spenser>Spenser</a>, <a href=# title=Brandon>Brandon</a>, and <a href=# title=Tucker>Tucker</a>.

When Guile notices this he has his Surskit use <a href=# title="Psybeam (move)">Psybeam</a> to force the Luxury Ball open, preventing it from fully capturing Jirachi. Eventually the Poké Ball breaks and Jirachi is freed, Guile takes this brief moment to retrieve his sword and attacks Anabel, Todd, and Emerald who are stuck to the floor thanks to the nectar that Surskit had dropped previously. Emerald's Pokémon step in to shield them and Guile attempts to grab Jirachi but it flees in fear. Muttering that he has four days left to capture Jirachi, an annoyed Guile takes his leave, insulting his enemies while doing so.</p><p><a href=# title=Scott>Scott</a> then reveals that he knew about Jirachi all this time, and that <a href=# title="Professor Oak (Adventures)">Professor Oak</a> was the one that informed Scott about the information. According to Professor Oak, Guile attacked Oak's Pokémon in his lab and stole enough of the deciphered ancient data regarding Jirachi to figure out where and when Jirachi was to awaken.</p><p>During the <a href=# title="Battle Arena">Battle Arena</a> battle between <a href=# title="Ruby (Adventures)">Ruby</a> and Emerald, it is revealed that Guile forced Emerald's Sceptile (then wild at the time) to the Battle Factory to wreak havoc because of the Poison Barb that was shot, though his plan was thwarted with Emerald's gadget.</p><p>Guile reappears after Emerald's Battle Arena challenge where he finally manages to capture Jirachi. The Frontier Brains attempt to attack to no avail again; he manages to escape with his Starmie and reveals his plan, to use the power Jirachi possesses and flood the entire <a href=# title="Battle Frontier (Generation III)">Battle Frontier</a>. He releases all of the rental Pokémon he had stolen before onto the public, forcing the Frontier Brains to go and save them.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/1/1c/Eternity_and_Instant.png/300px-Eternity_and_Instant.png decoding=async width=200 height=409 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> The Armor "Eternity" and Sword "Instant"<p>While Emerald, <a href=# title="Sapphire (Adventures)">Sapphire</a>, <a href=# title="Ruby (Adventures)">Ruby</a>, and <a href=# title=Noland>Noland</a> climb the Battle Frontier Guile tries to get Jirachi to grant his wish. Once they reach the top they find a mind controlled Anabel; Guile reveals that he had kidnapped her and used a <a href=# title="Psychic (type)">Psychic-type</a> Pokémon to control her mind. While Emerald fights Anabel, Ruby uses his Memory Lighter to try to figure out who Guile truly is, he uses a conversation he had with Spenser earlier and realizes that Guile is a person who must have come in contact with the <a href=# title="Blue Orb">Blue Orb</a>. After Anabel loses consciousness from the stress of the mind control, Emerald's Latios comes in to save them by bringing his Pokémon; he also reveals Guile Hideout's true identity. No longer needing to hide his face, Guile opens the mask on his helmet.</p><p>Guile forces Noland to give him the Jirachi Report by holding the unconscious Anabel captive, Noland is forced to comply and give him the report. With the Report, Guile manages to make his wish, to summon a giant sea demon that will flood the world. He then makes his leave, telling his enemies to drown while laughing.</p><p>He soon returns when he finds out that someone has appeared wearing a suit of armor similar to his, angry at the impostor he uses his sword to cut open his armor, revealing the person inside to be none other than <a href=# title="Gold (Adventures)">Gold</a>. Gold reveals that he wore the armor in an attempt to try to trick his Surskit which failed due to Guile coming back too soon. Guile and Gold begin battling, Gold sends out his <a href=# title=Aibo>Aibo</a> and <a href=# title=Exbo>Exbo</a> who use their abilities to create a wall of flames that Guile attempts to block. the flames are too powerful and he is knocked back. He continues battling Gold and the other <a href=# title="Pokédex holder">Pokédex holders</a> but defeats them by having his monster Kyogre flood the building, he reveals his second plan; to find the <a href=# title="Manaphy (Pokémon)">Legendary Pokémon</a> that lives in the ocean.</p><p>Gold and Crystal attempt to fight him while Emerald, Ruby, and Sapphire attempt to learn the ultimate moves <a href=# title="Frenzy Plant (move)">Frenzy Plant</a>, <a href=# title="Hydro Cannon (move)">Hydro Cannon</a>, and <a href=# title="Blast Burn (move)">Blast Burn</a> but Guile easily defeats them. This angers Emerald who attacks him but like Gold and Crystal, is easily knocked back. Guile steps on the heads of his Pokémon, calling them nothing but garbage due to their being unable to battle and questions the boy's concern, stating that he said that he only likes Pokémon battles and not the Pokémon themselves. This act causes Emerald to reveal that he does in fact like Pokémon, and the people who like Pokémon, causing Jirachi to grant his wish to free his senior Pokédex holders from their petrification.</p><p>Despite gaining five new opponents to fight, Guile is not fazed in the slightest and sends his rental Pokémon and monster Kyogre to attack them. The Pokédex holders continue battling the rental Pokémon while Emerald, Gold, and Red battle Guile and with a combination from Red's <a href=# title=Poli>Poli</a> and Gold's <a href=# title=Polibo>Polibo</a>, they manage to break Guile's armor off. Guile doesn't let this stop him and tries to use the rental Pokémon to attack but Emerald reveals that he used his abilities to calm them all down; Guile no longer has anything to attack them with. He is finally defeated when all of the Pokédex holders destroy his monster Kyogre with a quadruple combination of Frenzy Plant, Hydro Cannon, Blast Burn, and Volt Tackle.</p><p>After the monster Kyogre is destroyed, Emerald finds Guile's body floating in the water and grabs him. Guile tells him about how he received the Armor "Eternity" and Sword "Instant" from a <a href=# title=Sird>mysterious woman</a>. When he sees his armor, Guile immediately goes to grab it but finds out that it was the fake armor that Gold was wearing before; he frantically searches for the real one. Before he can reach the real armor, he disappears in a flash of light; the sword and armor disappear along with him. It was revealed later that the woman who gave him the armor was a member of a <a href=# title="Team Galactic">mysterious team</a>.</p><h3><span id=Diamond_.26_Pearl_arc></span><span class=mw-headline id=Diamond_&_Pearl_arc><a href=# title="Diamond & Pearl arc (Adventures)"><i>Diamond & Pearl</i> arc</a></span></h3><p>Guile appeared in Sird's flashback in <i><a href=# title=PS414>Double Trouble with Dialga and Palkia IV</a></i>.</p><h2><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon>Pokémon</span></h2><table align=left width=100%><tbody readability=4.2458100558659><tr readability=2><td colspan=2 rowspan=2 width=25% align=center><a href=# class=image title="Guile Hideout's Surskit"><img alt="Guile Hideout's Surskit" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/1/1d/Guile_Hideout_Surskit_Adventures.png/188px-Guile_Hideout_Surskit_Adventures.png decoding=async width=125 height=132 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><a href=# class=image title="Guile Hideout's Masquerain"><img alt="Guile Hideout's Masquerain" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/e/e9/Guile_Hideout_Masquerain_Adventures.png/300px-Guile_Hideout_Masquerain_Adventures.png decoding=async width=200 height=55 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p></td><td><b>Egg → Surskit → <span id=Masquerain></span>Masquerain <span>♂</span></b></td></tr><tr readability=8.3326271186441><td rowspan=5 align=left width=75% readability=5.2627118644068><a href=# title="Masquerain (Pokémon)">Masquerain</a> is Guile's most used Pokémon.
